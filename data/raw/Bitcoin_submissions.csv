I know that the US government can and may ultimately regulate BTC in a way that thwarts institutional investment, but the Bitcoin network would still live on and thrive despite regulatory setbacks. 

I know it is my own fault, but I will be paying dearly for holding onto my China ADRs. I may no longer be allowed to hold or trade NYSE: CHL after Jan. 11th, but at least my BTC can‚Äôt be pried away from me as easily. 

Freedom isn‚Äôt free, but the Bitcoin community is fighting the good fight. I‚Äôm not anti-tax or anti-regulation, but this is my first (very, very minor) taste of feeling robbed by my own government. I hope that Bitcoin can serve as a freeing asset for people subject to the truly evil and corrupt governments around the world and ultimately free us from the biggest shortcomings of what we call ‚Äúhuman nature.‚Äù

"",""," Throwaway for privacy,

I just had quite a stressful experience transferring some funds from a paper wallet to an exchange.

I‚Äôve written the story below share my experience to help any others in the same situation. And perhaps improve the user experience.

I used the android Mycelium wallet as it has been around for years and had good reputation years ago. 

I was using blockchain.info but it seems the paper wallet functionality has been completely broken by updates.

After scanning an encrypted paper wallet (bip38), I chose to send 2.5BTC of the 4.3BTC to an exchange.

I quickly received the funds but notice that the transaction showed:

2.64 from paper-wallet transferred to 2.5 (exchange) AND 0.14 to  a new address starting with 3LUkfjs....

 

This is when I started to panic and suspected Mycelium had become illegitimate.

(there is a lot of adds and banners bloating the app)

I was convinced it had skimmed some of my transaction into another address.

After several frustrating attempts at importing the encrypted key in another wallet to get the remaining 1.66BTC, I finally got them out of the (potentially compromised) paper wallet using an old version of [bitaddress.org](https://bitaddress.org/) and Electrum in windows.

This whole time I was rushing and disregarding some normal security protocols in an attempt the get the funds off before any malicious actor might.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After a stressful hour, I discovered that when importing a bip38 private key Mycelium lists 3: addresses that the key corresponds to.

When I did a partial spend. the 0.14BTC was sent to this other address (3LUkfjs‚Ä¶)

I was able to re-scan the paper wallet with Mycelium and spend the 0.14 from 3LUkfjs‚Ä¶

All in all, it was a very stressful experience and I did a number of risky things in my panic.  
 I considered myself fairly knowledgeable in bitcoin and yet this still happened. 

Hopefully this experience is helpful to others, take what you want from it.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko7ss9/story_long_term_holder_was_convinced_i_just_had/","Story: Long Term Holder, Was convinced I just had 0.13 BTC Stolen by Mycelium","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609488726","redditor for a day","{}","Bitcoin","10","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko7ss9/story_long_term_holder_was_convinced_i_just_had/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","throwaaybtcmycelium","t3_ko7ss9","","0","False","ko7ss9","8","noob","","False"

"","","will everyone or atleast in western world use bitcoins for everyday transactions? 

if yes can bitcoin system handle the complex transaction structure of millions of exchange occuring? 

will there be extra fees for low amount of transactions.

suppose one loaf of bread costs 0.00000001BTC will it costs the same or will there be extra fees? 

assuming some people dont use third party exchange but use cold wallet and they do deals like buying a plot of land with other party agrreing in btc payment. How would that transaction be not illegal? wouldnt govt want to be third eye and get its tax share.


one last question, if everyone is saying here to buy bitcoins no matter what and hold. assuming it hits 500k or 1million.whats the point? lets say everyone held their btc and ater started selling. wouldnt price fall down. who would buy it then. even if there is goal why is no one talking about it. satoshi didnt make the system for pump and dump he wanted a currency that isnt centralised yet no major decentralised system other than core itself.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko79qy/will_bitcoin_be_the_future_currency/","Will bitcoin be the future currency?","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609485797","","{}","Bitcoin","8","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko79qy/will_bitcoin_be_the_future_currency/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","anotheravailabledumb","t3_ko79qy","","0","False","ko79qy","8","","","False"

"","","Bitcoin and I go way back in 2010 when I signed up for a meet-up event but cancelled in Toronto. At the time, they were offering to buy some for $90 (if I recall) but I didn't because my thought process was, why am I dropping that amount when Microsoft was only in low 20s, (Note: This was just after America's financial collapse) and what the hell was bitcoin?  Then I signed up to Coinbase 3 years ago but never really did anything because I thought, it was too volatile and the narrative was ""it's only for terrorists and drug dealers.""  
Fast forward to today and Coinbase doesn't allow more than $300 if you're from Canada.  
Is there a reputable exchange that I can trust with my entry purchase?  It's worth more than $300.

"","","I'm posting this here with a throwaway account as I haven't received any fixes on the Wasabi thread. 

So I recently purchased the Coldcard which uses the seeds (all 25words) from my Trezor. When I exported the wallet from Coldcard to a json file and imported it into Wasabi, I can only see the bitcoins from my Trezor Account #1 but not the coins in the other Trezor Accounts #2 and so on. Trezor lets the user create multiple accounts **within the same wallet which is derived from the same seed**. All the addresses are in bech32 already. 

I'm pretty sure this this is a derivation path issue. I.e. Wasabi is able to look at the appropriate derivation path for Trezor account #1 but it doesn't by default look for other accounts which may be using a different derivation path. I'm not sure how to fix this... any suggestions would be appreciated.

I'm conducting a survey and I would really appreciate it if you could provide some minimal feedback to help improve the the future landscape for crypto exchanges. 

1) are you happy with our current exchange options?
2) which exchange is your current favorite?
3) which ones do you dislike, and why?
4) what is most important to you in an exchange? 
5) in your opinion, what is the biggest problem with the current options? What is missing?

"","","If your getting bored sifting through the price posts, heres something to keep you busy till things settle down.  Here's my suggested New Year's reading list to people interested in learning bitcoin.  As you progress you can pickup some C++ and Python and try your hand at contributing.  If you do, read the [contributing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) doc and start there.  Bitcoin's is better than most projects in this regard, they even have a dedicated tag to flag easy issues to solve for noob devs to issue a PR to.

Reading list (in order)

1. [Lopp's Bitcoin Resource Page](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html)
2. [Antonopoulos' Bitcoin Book](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook#reading-this-book)
3. [Lopp's Lightning Resource Page](https://www.lopp.net/lightning-information.html)
4. [Antonopoulos' Lightning Book](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook#status) (about half done)

Since Lopp and Antonopoulos give this info out for free, consider giving them a donation.  You can get their Bitcoin addresses from their following profile pages:

* [Jameson Lopp](https://keybase.io/lopp)
* [Andreas M. Antonopoulos](https://aantonop.com/donate/)

And if that is not deep enough for you

1. [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) (easiest language for most to learn)
2. [GPG Beginners Guide](https://gnupg.org/documentation/index.html) (will teach fundamentals of crypto)
3. [Electrum Manual](https://electrum.org/#documentation) (best SPV wallet)
3. [Electrum Source Code](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/) (easiest for most to understand)
4. [Bitcoin Core v0.1.5](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v0.1.5) (only 20k lines, not difficult at all)
5. [Edward Snowden Book](https://www.overdrive.com/media/4775028/) (Ch 22, 23 and 24 cover ELI5 encryption)

Since the Snowden book has had all the proceeds siezed by the US government, best not buy a copy, it would just be a political donation to the US intelegance community.  You can buy the book internationally, get it from a library (tracked), or pirate it.  If pirated, you can donate to Snowden directly, though that too would likely be flagged.  His legal fund donation address is:

* 3C6qQ&gt;!***\\_\\_\\_REDACTED\\_\\_\\_REDACTED\\_\\_\\_***!&lt;QPfnH &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (redacted, but easy enough to find)

For a PhD, add these to the list:

1. SEC 1 spec from [secg.org](https://www.secg.org/)
1. SEC 2 spec (secp256k1) from [secg.org](https://www.secg.org/)
3. [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
4. [Bitcoin BIP (protocol enhancements)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/README.mediawiki)
5. [Lightning Network whitepaper](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf)
6. [Lightning Network RFCs (protocol enhancements)](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/00-introduction.md)

I have researched the topic of securing  bitcoin and I have always heard that once you forget your seed, your bitcoin are gone as well. So if your Trezor spits out your words, you better pay attention.... But now I have heard, that you can Recover your seed, as long as you still have your functioning hardware wallet. I am confused... would it not be overkill to have several copies of your seed or to put it on a metal plate? I mean you would basically have to lose seed and wallet at the same time.

To start off the new year, I was hoping we could get a thread going on the fastest, safest, and easiest way to start investing in bitcoin. A lot of us just received our stimulus, and want to put that money to use and join the the HODL gang.  


Are there easy steps to follow? Any recommended guides that are up to date and safe?

"","","Since there are many people sharing their bitcoin stories, I want to share mine.

I learned about bitcoin from a coworker soon after starting a position at NASA Goddard in early 2017, where worked to manage weather satellite algorithms. He had been using some old GPUs to mine in his basement, and showed me the genesis block, hash functions, and live blockchain transactions as they came over the network. It was clearly a side-project for him, but I began taking my own interest in it when I came home from work.

It was my first job after grad school, and I had just finished setting up my 401K benefits when I decided to buy a little bitcoin as well. I figured that if public markets were theoretically the most intelligently priced, bitcoin must have a lot of potential, because it was the freest market imaginable. This came at a time of living in the DC area and an exposure to national politics and spending time writing a personal novel downtown after work when I didn‚Äôt have many connections. I learned about quantitative easing, fiscal policy, and the move off the gold standard. It further solidified my bitcoin obsession and I wound up on Poloniex from the June 2017 altcoin season. Of course, I was a newbie and lost just as much as I gained. In the end I realized all I cared about was increasing my BTC (and EOS position at the time). Back then it was and still is only a moderate amount.

After that, I held until the end of the year when I sold a bunch of BTC and paid off my car. But all along I knew it was a short term top, so my obsession continued. I ended up leaving my job at NASA to find a blockchain group where I could use my software engineering skills. I did indeed find a healthcare startup, but didn‚Äôt have the web experience to contribute much to the team.

Last year my primarily financial obsession with Bitcoin changed, when I slowly formulated an idea. I was and still am obsessed with blockchain (eosio in particular), and I found some place to feel at peace with the price swings and missed opportunities margin trading.    Applying my knowledge and understanding of climate, I started a company to launch weather balloons in West Africa to collect weather data and reward students with digital currency. I learned about micro-controllers, IoT, web development, and 3D printing and made my prototype ideas a reality. I feel compelled to do this, because I believe there are only a handful of people that have the technical background in weather, software, and climate to found a company like this.

Two months ago a press release by CoinDesk was shared on NASDAQ‚Äôs website.

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/west-african-program-will-store-weather-data-on-telos-blockchain-2020-11-10

Even though my BTC stacks are only moderate, I don‚Äôt feel as though I‚Äôm missing an opportunity by not leveraging long on an exchange, because I see my project as a Call option on crypto in general.

Maybe there‚Äôs someone else out there that feels guilty about not leveraging their own BTC to make even more profit. If that‚Äôs case, I encourage them to get creative and use their own background to improve or change society in one way or another. After all, we all come from different places and can bring something new to the table.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kof350/my_story_from_nasa_to_bitcoin/","My story from NASA to bitcoin","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609522026","","{}","Bitcoin","52","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kof350/my_story_from_nasa_to_bitcoin/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","sunburntcat","t3_kof350","","1","False","kof350","9","","","False"

"","","**Short version:**

Decentralized group of oracles publish PGP public keys, followed after a delay by the corresponding private keys. Bitcoiners can get some physical security by time locking keys needed to spend utxos by encrypting the spend keys to a PGP public key published by the oracle. In order to spend the funds, they must wait for the private key to be published. If a robber asks them to send funds, it is not possible to do so without waiting for the timeout or by some other method that is not attractive for the robber. This is sort of like CLTV, but you can ‚Äúrenew‚Äù the timeout without making an on chain transaction.

---

**Long version:**

As the price of bitcoin goes up, bitcoin holders may worry about their physical security. The best case scenario is when no one knows about the wealth you control, but this may not be achievable for everyone due to exchange data spills, KYC record keeping, tax reporting requirements or other information leaks.

What can you do to protect yourself from the dreaded five dollar wrench attack or hostage ransom attack? A dog and a shotgun are nice to have, but it is fundamentally very difficult to defend yourself from a physical attack from a smart, patient adversary.

It‚Äôs worth noticing that there have been publicly identifiable rich people for a long time, yet robberies and hostage attacks remain infrequent. Unfortunately, Bitcoin has properties that give reason to suspect that physical attacks could be more likely.

1. You do not need to involve or inform any other people to transfer bitcoin to an attacker‚Äôs address. Bitcoin transfers are **private**.

2. You can transfer a fortune in bitcoin within a few minutes. Bitcoin transfers are **fast**.

3. Bitcoin transfers are **irreversible**.

These properties are great to have when you need them, but having all three could be a big liability, if it attracts robbers.

In order to thwart attackers, it would be a good idea to set it up so that you cannot have all three at the same time. For example, you could lock your coins with a script that allows the coins to be spent either with the help of a third party, or no sooner than one year in the future. That way you cannot pay a robber without involving the third party, and if the third party fails you get your coins back at the end of the year.

As a more flexible variation on the above idea, suppose that there were some oracle ‚Äî perhaps a tor hidden service ‚Äî that simply published a PGP public key every day, and then 30 days later it published the corresponding private key. Perhaps it would sell the private key for a fee over the lightning network. Now your coins could be locked with a script that opens two ways:

1. You can spend the coins immediately.

2. You can spend the coins at the end of one year.

Then you encrypt the spend key for Option 1 to the PGP key of the oracle, and delete your unencrypted copies of the spend key. Now the coins are locked for 30 days, until the oracle publishes the PGP private key. Once the PGP private key is published, you could decrypt your spend private key and if you like, you could encrypt it again to a new PGP public key published by the oracle to again lock the coins for 30 days.

---

**Automatic Lock Renewal**

As a method to automatically renew the lock, what you could do is the following.

* Oracle has a list of 30 secrets. It switches to the next secret every day. After the final secret it switches back to the first secret.
* You send a secret to the Oracle, and ask to make a public key.
* The Oracle combines your secret with the Oracle's secret for that day. Oracle uses a secure hash to combine the Oracle secret and your secret. (Let's say the secret is an ECIES private key.)
* The Oracle sends you back the corresponding public key.
* You encrypt your file to the public key and delete the original.
* Now you have to wait until 30 days pass and the Oracle returns to the correct secret, so that you are able to obtain your key. If you do not obtain the secret, the window closes at the end of the day for 30 more days.
* Attacker cannot get your private key from the oracle before robbing you because they do not have your secret.

Keys in the oracle carousel could expire after some number of rotations (e.g. expire after 12 rotations and become accessible every day for some grace period like 1 year so that people can use them to decrypt their files and move them to a different carousel key.)

---

**Additional thoughts:**

* Oracles could publish a PGP public key each day, and make the corresponding private key accessible one year later. If you wanted to lock your coins for a shorter time, just pick an older PGP public key, for example pick one published 335 days ago so that you can get the private key in 30 days.

* For redundancy you could encrypt your private key with PGP keys from several different Oracles.

* Wallets could handle all of this time-locking behind the scenes and simply present the user with a ‚Äúlock coins for x days‚Äù interface.

* Locking can occur on a per-utxo basis, so you could stagger your utxos on the calendar. E.g. you could give yourself access to a different chunk of bitcoin each month for 12 months.

* If you find that you need to sell a bunch of bitcoin, but yours are all locked up, you can always use loans and futures contracts.

* An alternative to CLTV for a backup spend method could be something like an M of N Shamir scheme with shards at several bank deposit boxes, lawyer, etc.

* Oracle‚Äôs could get paid for private keys with lightning, and use lightning capacity as an anti Sybil proof.

* This idea is very private and decentralized. For example, the Oracle has no insight into who uses the service, or how much money is being protected.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kod6h9/key_calendar_for_physical_security/","Key Calendar for Physical Security","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609515465","","{}","Bitcoin","6","1610058040.0","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kod6h9/key_calendar_for_physical_security/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","moral_agent","t3_kod6h9","","0","False","kod6h9","1","","","False"

BITCOIN PRICE

I love Bitcoin, and I want other people to love it too, although I never force-feed anything. Even when I'm asked to talk a little about Bitcoin, however, one of the excuses I most often hear for why someone ""can't"" buy Bitcoin right now is because it's ""too expensive.""

Sure, the price of one Bitcoin as of this writing is about $29,480 each. However, that is only because of what we, as people, define ""one Bitcoin"" to mean. Satoshi, whoever he is, arbitrarily decided that ""100 million Satoshis = 1 Bitcoin."" So, when we look at Bitcoins as shares, similar to how public companies have shares outstanding, there are 21 million of them max...divided into the market value you get the ""share price"" of $29,480 for one share.

However, that definition was arbitrary. Perhaps Satoshi could have just as easily decreed that ""100 thousand Satoshis = 1 Bitcoin"" so that what we all know today as 1 mBTC would be ""1 Bitcoin."" As such, there'd be 21 billion ""shares"" of Bitcoin instead of 21 million. All of us today would still be praising the finite limit of ""only"" 21 billion Bitcoins. The difference is that today ""one Bitcoin"" would be $29.48 instead of $29,480. Would we all be collectively creaming our pants watching the Bitcoin price go from $21 to $23, to $28, etc., like we all currently do at every $1,000 price increase milestone? I don't know, but a stock price going from $21 to $25 to $30, etc. definitely isn't as exciting as $21,000 to $30,000, and a stock price going from $20 to $200 ($20K to $200K) or higher isn't unheard of either. Apple has about 18 billion shares outstanding on its own.

Anyways, all this is to say, yes, what we see as the Bitcoin price right now doesn't matter, or at least, isn't what most people think it is. Most people don't understand that the price is what it is because of how we arbitrarily defined Bitcoin within the protocol's number of total tokens. A different definiton would make Bitcoin the same thing, but have a ""lower, much more reasonable"" price of maybe $29.48 today, meaning more people would feel more comfortable buying at these prices.

What does this mean? I'm not sure. Is it a mental barrier that will be overcome throughout the populous over time? Is Bitcoin an IQ test and people who believe it too expensive based on sticker price simply fail? One thing I'm pretty sure of, however, is that those who do realize and understand this, can better understand why Bitcoin is still cheap...and not ""pie in the sky expensive"" like many people still seem to believe and therefore do not act on acquiring any.

TLDR Don't consider the Bitcoin price, only its market value.

&amp;#x200B;

""OWNING"" BITCOIN

There seems to be a trend of corporations holding a part of their treasury holdings as Bitcoin, meaningfully kicked off by Microstrategy. I don't see any reason why this trend won't continue. I can imagine a not-too-distant future in which it could be commonplace for companies to hold 1%/5%/10%/etc. of their cash in Bitcoin.

If this is the case, does this mean the average person can get enough Bitcoin exposure simply by holding a fund of, for example, S&amp;P 500 companies? If most companies hold Bitcoin, and I'm holding SPY, do I get enough Bitcoin exposure through that such that I don't need to hold Bitcoins on my own in order to protect my portfolio from inflation, etc.? I'd just get exposure indirectly through owning shares of companies that hold it.

Yes, I understand ""not your keys, not your Bitcoin"" and all that. I'm just talking about the normies, not the diehard hardware-wallet holding, key splitting, ""fuck the man!"" type of Bitcoin holders ( who are cool too!). For the average person, assuming more/most companies do hold Bitcoin, does one get ""enough"" exposure to Bitcoin by simply holding a diversified stock fund?

And if so, would there even be advantages? For example, if each company is holding their own Bitcoins and presumably either managing their own keys or using different custodians, etc., does that diversify away some risk of securing your Bitcoins? Owning a Ledger for all your Bitcoins is cool but if you lose your seed phrase you're kind of fucked. Just a thought.

This is why I think that I wouldn't mind, one day when the time is right, to exchange some of my after-tax hodlings to keep in equities. ""Time is right"" meaning that companies are actually doing this. Would it be enough for normies? Would love to hear others' thoughts.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kooqbx/a_couple_of_bitcoin_bathtub_thoughts/","A Couple of Bitcoin Bathtub Thoughts","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609554138","","{}","Bitcoin","2","1609554528.0","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kooqbx/a_couple_of_bitcoin_bathtub_thoughts/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","edwinthepig","t3_kooqbx","","0","False","kooqbx","5","","","False"

"","","I've bought bitcoin in the past but immediately used it to purchase things. This time I'm holding on. Excited to see where it takes me.

Edit: I understand I've bought at a high. But the  200 to me is inconsequential right now and I just wanted to get started and 30k could be its low now if it climbs to 100k. I will now buy at dips from kraken and transfer to a hardware wallet.

"","","does anyone here actually have a plan to sell at some point?

models like s2f which if followed to their conclusion will have bitcoin worth more than all the real estate in the world in not too long a time. There is absolutely no way this will or can happen, the utlity value of real estate is always gonna be worth more than something like bitcoin. so there is no way this model or similar models can be accurate.

ok lets say bitcoin completely replaces the entire banking system and gold (which it wont replace either ever, but for arguments sake lets say it 100% replaces them)..... im gonna round up that value to $20 trillion.

which rounding up again is 1 million USD per bitcoin. is that the kind of number everyone here is waiting for?

i have purchased bitcoin 3 times starting in 2013 and sold out completely 3 times. my last purchase was earlier this year at approx $6 XXX

the most worrything thing to look at if you are long is how many wallets are worth more than 1 million USD vs say 6 months ago. the number is insanely larger, like 3x. at some point, there is going to be intense pressure for these millionaires to cash in. you can live in a brand new house your bitcoin buys and pass that on to your family for generations, you cannot live in your bitcoin.

does the sell pressure happen at 30k? or 250k? i dont know.... im all ears on that one.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/komibp/bitcoin_cannot_increase_in_value_forever_relative/","Bitcoin cannot increase in value forever relative to everything else.","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609546327","","{}","Bitcoin","100","1609546643.0","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/komibp/bitcoin_cannot_increase_in_value_forever_relative/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","MonkeyMotoman","t3_komibp","","0","False","komibp","274","","","False"

"","","Two part question. I use Copay on my Mac to store my bitcoin, and I've read some negative things about this, due to its relationship with BitPay (in fact, the Copay wallet seems to have [merged completely with BitPay](https://github.com/bitpay/copay)). Do you agree that Copay is unsafe to use as a desktop wallet? I've enjoyed Copay (clean UI, and its features are sufficient for me) but if there's some underlying risk to using it then I'd rather just move away from it.

If so, I'd probably switch to Electrum as that is what I see recommended. If I do this, when setting up Electrum, is it better to restore my same wallet using my seed (again, any risk with this due to the seed being used in the Copay wallet), or just create a brand new wallet and send the BTC to myself? The second option seems overall easier but maybe unnecessary.

For context, I'm a fairly recreational bitcoin investor and use my wallet to pay for occasional things like depositing money on betting sites and whatnot, but generally just looking to hodl. I don't need to run my own node or anything but I do understand the importance of a non-custodial wallet.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kolvh3/is_copay_an_okay_wallet_and_if_not_whats_the_best/","Is Copay an okay wallet, and if not, what's the best way to move to a new wallet?","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609544216","","{}","Bitcoin","3","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kolvh3/is_copay_an_okay_wallet_and_if_not_whats_the_best/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","sakic87","t3_kolvh3","","0","False","kolvh3","9","","","False"

"","","I apologize if I‚Äôm completely missing something here as I‚Äôm brand new to Bitcoin but the common trend I see with BTC is that you buy and hold for a LONG time and only cash out for a legitimate reason whatever that may be for you. 

My question is; is it common for people to take profits say monthly while never withdrawing more than your original investment? If you‚Äôre up just say 50k at the end of the year what would the difference be if you wait the year to take profits than taking profits every few weeks or something? Because if it crashes overnight at least you have the profit you‚Äôve already taken but if it keeps steady the whole year you‚Äôre still in the same position as before

"","","An article in El Mundo today - one of the main newspapers in Spain - talks about the situation of Gibraltar and their investment movements after losing a lot of their business because of Brexit.

A bit of political context: Gibraltar is a UK territory which is located in the south of Spain. It has a land border with Spain. Spain is working on a deal with Gibraltar, and there won‚Äôt be a border between that non-EU territory and Spain.

Economic context of Gibraltar - Gibraltar money comes mostly from the financial sector and from online game and bets as well from tourism. Since the UK was going to abandon the EU, they have lost a lot of the big companies to Malta or Luxembourg - tax reasons. 

Because of this, the article quotes: ‚ÄúThey have discarded a lot of toxic assets and have a lot of legislation controls to become a referent inside the Bitcoin market and mostly in Blockchain‚Äù

"","","I'm loving the price rises, the start of a new bull run, the inflows from institutions, the favorable press from People Who Matter(TM) etc as much as anyone, and I'm holding forever because I buy into the long-term proposition that BTC is a generational store of value, like most capital assets, but...

1. Do we really know what the institutions' plans are medium- to long-term? I agree with the consensus that they're getting in at least partly to shield themselves from the beating that fiat is about to take from central banks, but what happens if/when central banks once again get a hold on inflation? What happens when interest rates pick back up? Institutions move in and out of gold under the same circumstances. For that matter, what if we're all wrong and the institutions are in this for the bull run? What if they're all planning to profit-take at $50k? I understand that any specific scenario on its own is unlikely, but my point is that their intentions aren't fully knowable. They can read charts much better than most of ""us"". They know when the last halving was. Maybe whales don't manipulate the price anymore, but I'm far from convinced that institutional investments constitute legitimacy on the same scale as precious metals yet.
2. Which brings me to point #2. How much of BTC's rise against fiat lately is pricing in the expectation of future fiat inflation? Everyone who genuinely thinks they're buying a Lambo when BTC hits $1M might be in for some serious disappointment when they discover that fiat inflation means that Lambos start at $4M by the time Lamborghini starts accepting payment in BTC. I'm exaggerating, of course, but on the other hand, BTC has risen about 430% (6784 to 29917) in the last 12 months as compared with USD. If you compare it with XAU, it's only 280% (5.59 to 15.74). Those are substantially different, and enough to make me concerned about the true value of the apparent price rise. Speculating is completely pointless at this stage, but I find it interesting to wonder what the ultimate ""fair"" price of goods in sats/BTC will be, and how sellers will behave.

Footnote to point 2: An additional thing to worry about there is why people will ever spend BTC. Unless we get to the (IMO, extremely unlikely) scenario of 100% global adoption as the sole means of exchange, the incentives will always be in favour of saving/investing BTC (no, maxis, DeFi is not going away. Yes people must be able to invest BTC and get a return, otherwise it forms a shitty economic system which people will abandon because it fails to allow for the creation of wealth.) and spending whatever alternative is less deflationary/provides less return. Basically the only way people will be incentivised to spend BTC is if their creditors only accept BTC for payment of debts and obligations. Otherwise you're using an inherently deflationary asset to pay inflationary obligations.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise these are not popular talking points. I realise I'm mixing short- and long-term problems in the same post. I am prepared for incoming thrown projectiles from people whose mellow I'm harshing. I'd love to have it explained to me what I'm missing that these worries aren't real concerns. Also, in this sub with all the threads about new ATHs every 20 minutes and the undeniable excitement because we genuinely are at the beginning of a new bullrun, it can be very lonely to feel like I don't know exactly what I'm buying long-term, and it'd be nice to know if anyone else shares these concerns.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kouk1c/two_things_that_bother_me_about_btc/","Two things that bother me about BTC...","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609579154","","{}","Bitcoin","6","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kouk1c/two_things_that_bother_me_about_btc/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","Difficult-Outside350","t3_kouk1c","","0","False","kouk1c","17","","","False"

"","","Sorry if this is silly I am still new to understanding how this works. 

I understand that when miners create a block in the blockchain that they receive their block reward. Is the bitcoin they receive the only -new- bitcoin that gets generated into circulation? 

For instance hypothetically if all of the bitcoin miners decided to hold onto the bitcoin they receive from creating blocks would there be no -new- bitcoins entering circulation? Due to the only new coins entering the circulation are from their reward? 

If this is true what is the incentive for bitcoin miners to sell to exchanges when they could hold onto their coins?

"","","Hey guys,

I'm a bit confused about my recent BTC transaction fee. 60$ seems a lot to me. As far as I understood the fee depends on how fast I want it to be and on the actual **byte size** of the transaction. The byte size is the part that confuses me: Block Explorer shows about 52.000 byte and 88 previous transactions which is a lot more than I usually have. (I assume the more transactions, the higher the size) So my question is, how can I avoid this? Will I have to pay the same fee (+1 tx) next time I move the coins? And what about future transactions? It obviously can not rise to infinity. I feel like I'm missing a crucial point here ...

Thank you!

Edit: Transfer was from Kraken to my hardware wallet.

Edit2: I actually did not pay 0.002 BTC!! I paid only the fee Kraken showed (which makes sense). I was not aware of the batching concept.

Thank you all!","","misleading","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kou9pp/i_paid_60_0002_btc_transaction_fee_for_a_single/","I paid 60$ (0.002 BTC) transaction fee for a single transaction.

"","","1. **We have cheated the system**. We found a crack in the central bank system, which has been operating for over 100 years. A system invented and implemented by the richest and most influential people on this planet. A system that has survived two world wars, great crises, 45 years of cold global war. A system that surrounds us, that has been accepted by all governments of the world. A system that is an objective reality.
2. **We deceive ourselves**. The return to reality will be painful. The system will easily show its strength and win. For the time being it ignores us, but when it really feels threatened it will easily crush us.

Occam's razor points to 2. As a born pessimist and rational person I am also inclined to this option.

This can create a record keeping nightmare as well as added expenses come April 15th for anyone using Bitcoin to make payments.

"","","One of the greatest strides being made on bitcoin‚Äôs second layer is  the development of a market for liquidity. Bitcoin is a scarce commodity  and can be ‚Äúpointed‚Äù in channels to other peers on the lightning  network. The open bitcoin lightning network is now beginning to price  the demand for scarce liquidity in lightning channels. The toolset is  expanding rapidly and u/LightningLiquidityBot is a great place to start.

Lightning channels allow near-instant settlement of bitcoin  transactions, which is a valuable service, especially to retailers and  exchanges. Similar to how retailers will pay credit card fees to provide  convenience to their customers, retailers will buy lightning channels  that provide rapid settlement for their bitcoin patrons. The pricing is  very different though: Credit Card companies will often charge  2-4%  fees, while Lightning Liquidity is market-driven and currently less than  0.2% fees.

Offer Markovich, an enterprising developer from Israel, assembled the  Lightning Liquidity Bot (@LightningLiquidityBot) as a way to create an  open market for liquidity. The bot is based in Telegram and is an  attractive alternative to Lightning Lab‚Äôs Pool service.

"","","Around the week of December 17th I purchased 0.53 BTC. Earlier in December a full coin was around 18k so I sold off some stuff and purchased a ledger wallet. By the time I was ready to go 1 BTC was around 24k but I couldn‚Äôt get any of my transactions to go through, ledger and coinbase just wouldn‚Äôt work, I tried contacting support and the longer I waited the higher it went. Finally like I said, around Dec 17 I bought 0.53 BTC but I used robinhood. I‚Äôm kicking myself because had I used robinhood earlier as my wife suggested instead of all the troubleshooting I did I would have been able to buy a full coin. Regardless half a coin is better than no coin at all.

This will propel Bitcoin to be worth more than Tesla, probably at Par with apple for a while and then it will tend towards the marketcap of Gold.

"","","I bought BTC for the first time on Binance and am dismayed at their fees. I got $202 in BTC for $210 charged to my bank debit card.

**My question is: Can I transfer from my Binance wallet to LocalBitcoins via Binance Smart Chain?** It is telling me here [https://www.binance.com/en/my/wallet/account/main/withdrawal/crypto/BTC](https://www.binance.com/en/my/wallet/account/main/withdrawal/crypto/BTC) that the Bitcoin wallet fee is $16 to transfer my wallet balance.

"","","I posted a week ago about my 5 bitcoins I purchased in 3013.  I forgot my password and tried desperately to get in at the last boom of 2018.  No success.  I gave up on them and put it out of my mind until someone just told me bitcoin was worth about thirty thousand.  I'm a bar owner and my life has been turned upside down because of covid.  Lost two of my bars and been unemployed for nine months.  I became again obsessed with my bitcoin and dreaming of a Christmas miracle.  As a last ditch effort I turned to Bitcoin dave with little to no expectations.  On new years Eve at around 8pm I sent him my wallet with a list of potential words all of which I had exhausted in attempts.  To my SHEER AMAZEMENT an hour's later I got an email from Bitcoin dave saying he had gotten into my wallet!  The password was 22 CHARACTERS LONG.  And nothing I would have ever dreamed to try   Two years ago when I tried to get in blockchain told me the password was 6 characters!  The story is not a happy one though as my bitcoins had been removed from my wallet in 2014 most likely by my""friend"" whom helped me get them and whom I had entrusted to help me get them out in 2014.  It was truly devastating but I guess the only way this shitty fucking year could end.  At any rate as heartbroken as I am i wanted to still give bitcoin dave a HUGE shout out for doing what I thought wasn't possible.  I HIGHLY recommend his services.

EDIT.  Let me be clear Dave did not steal my bit coin, the registry is clear to see, my bitcoin was moved into a different wallet in 2014.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kpe8im/bitcoin_dave_and_httpswalletrecoveryservicescom/","Bitcoin dave and https://walletrecoveryservices.com/ blows my mind.","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609650395","","{}","Bitcoin","6","1609652028.0","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kpe8im/bitcoin_dave_and_httpswalletrecoveryservicescom/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","fengaged","t3_kpe8im","","0","False","kpe8im","10","","","False"

"","","I'm hearing a lot of chatter about how the next run up will be different as we now have major institutional involvement, and their diamond hands won't be selling, etc. Well, I think this will likely be true to some degree, but I think that what people aren't considering enough is that there will also be heavy hitting trade desks and prop firms that are going to be getting a lot more active in crypto and you can sure as hell bet those guys are going to be selling when things get as technically overextended as they are now. Honestly, I think you could make a good argument that they might even cause increased volatility as they will be aggressively playing both sides potentially driving price faster and harder as a result of more short/margin activity.

I think right now is a perfect example of how that could play out. Were at 33k and clearly pretty extended on almost all timeframes. If/when the momentum starts to turn, there will likely be some bit short positions taken. Say they ride those positions down 20-30% and then decide that they are happy and want to cover their position -- in order to do so they will obviously have to start buying would could then trigger price to turn right around.

Obviously these are just the basic mechanics of the market that have always been in play, although I think we should consider the possibility that there will be some players with no intention of just holding and are just here to ride the waves.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kpe7db/low_volatility_moving_forward_i_dont_buy_it/","Low volatility moving forward?

"","","I understand the people who believe that we should just invest an amount that we can afford to lose in bitcoin. For me, that is applicable for speculative plays/assets. With more than a decade under its belt, I do not think bitcoin is pure speculative anymore. Some of its supposed uses are currently being tested.

What I am trying to say is that it is not really the price that you should just be looking into. It is also about its uses. If somehow the government or anything will disrupt its use, that is the time to sell. Without disruption, you can just buy the dip or keep on putting money. 

With the arrival of the big institutions, I think the smart money is now accepting some or maybe the majority of its supposed role in finance. I do believe that this is the reason why bitcoin bounce-back last March together with all the other assets. 

And also the possible reason why we have not seen a 25% correction at its run above $20K. 

And personally, my favorite use of bitcoin is that it is anti-inflation. And for super rich people and entities, this is actually important to them. Normally, super rich guys/entities hate losing money and they understand that dormant money is losing value due to inflation.

Do you think those institutions primarily entered their money in bitcoin because they want to speculate it reaching $200K? I do not think that is the case. Most of them will be happy of gaining 10% annually, just to avoid the effect of inflation.  


If my thought process is true, Bitcoin will just keep on getting higher. So, instead of looking at the price, I think it is much better actually that you look for ways to get more cash to enter into bitcoin, while taking notes of the risk that could disrupt its use.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kpe79q/bitcoin_is_not_a_speculative_play_anymore/","Bitcoin is not a speculative play anymore","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609650258","","{}","Bitcoin","1","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kpe79q/bitcoin_is_not_a_speculative_play_anymore/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","bigmatch","t3_kpe79q","","0","False","kpe79q","0","","","False"

I‚Äôve been lurking here since March and the amount of knowledge I‚Äôve amassed from you all has been indescribable. 

Unfortunately, before I took the plunge into r/Bitcoin, I bought my first sats in March 2020 on Robinhood and have been DCAing ever since.

I have accumulated a decent position and am torn on what to do come March 2021. I want to move it over to Gemini or Kraken, but am waiting for obvious tax purposes.

The question I have is, should I sell my whole
position at once on RH and take the tax hit for 2021 or slowly sell and transition it over the course of a few years to spread out my tax liability? My main fear is the 7-10 days or more it‚Äôll take to transfer it all over and missing out if there is a run similar to how the past week has gone.

"","","CS major here, I'm really struggling to understand some of Bitcoin basic terminology  (even after using it for years).

I have some very dumb questions that I can't seem to find easy answers to:

\\- **why** do public keys exist in the first place?

\\----- moving edit here since it changes the question dramatically

**EDIT:**

I think I should flip the question and instead of asking ""what's the purpose of public keys"" I should ask ""what's the purpose of addresses, why not just using public keys for receiving money?

\\-----

**Edit: Changed the post to better reflect my question .**

Just to clarify, I'm **not** asking:

~~- or how to get a public key from a private key?~~

~~-  how to get a bitcoin address from a public key?~~

I'm asking **why** do \\~public keys\\~ addresses exist in the first place, what's their purpose? As I understand we can use private keys (to spend) + \\~addresses\\~ public keys (to receive). What is then the purpose of an address?

Are public keys just an implementation detail that allows us to calculate multiple addresses for a specific private key, or is there something else to it?

https://preview.redd.it/46skste8l1961.png?width=2090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8e0c6e0e9a2fdf76a0e611a0b15c7161233f8e1

\\~Public keys\\~ addresses get mentioned **everywhere** even in bitcoin introductions for beginners. So my guess is they must do something else that I'm missing. An introduction to bitcoin for beginners wouldn't bring up elliptic curve cryptography, another technical implementation detail. So, do addresses have any other purpose other than receiving money (sisnce you can do that with public key) ?

Additional quesitons

A private key has 1, or multiple public keys?

Can I pay to a public key? or does it always has to be an address?

"","","Everyone investing in Bitcoin for the long term should have at least a familiarity with Executive Order 6102.  This executive order, signed by President Roosevelt in 1933 outlawed the personal ownership of gold over a very small amount. The Executive Order required individuals to sell their gold to the Fed for $20.67 per ounce ($408 today‚Äôs equivalent). Violation of the order was punishable by a fine of $10,000 ($198,000 today‚Äôs equivalent) and/or ten years in prison.

I point this out only b/c precedent has been set, and legality established, that the U.S. govt is within the law to force sale of an asset class. I‚Äôm not suggesting it‚Äôs an imminent threat, only that there is some precedent for the U.S. govt to intervene and make owning, buying or selling something like Bitcoin illegal for citizens of America

"","","Bitcoin was created to give financial sovereignty - rightfully ours - to the individual, by ""stealing"" it back from the nation-state, that foulest of usurpers. Bitcoin is a tool, but is also a tremendously powerful weapon. Unlike all prior attempts to accomplish this feat throughout history, Bitcoin does not rely on violence but, instead, works insidiously by turning capitalism against itself.

Knowing this, the rational capitalist should avoid Bitcoin at all costs. Of course, capitalism isn't rational (or sane), nor are most capitalists aware of what I just explained to you, nor can any of them resist the new economic reality that Bitcoin inevitably creates.

Capitalism is like anaerobic bacteria, and transparency is oxygen. Bitcoin forces capitalism into an environment (the publicly auditable blockchain) which is ""hyper-oxygenated"" with transparency, and therefore toxic and ultimately fatal to capitalism. Once a sufficient fraction of Earth's wealth has been absorbed onto the blockchain, humanity will be forced to stare this structural genocide in the face, and at some point compassion and ethics will take hold once again. That will be the point at which capitalism breaks down completely, and then we transcend away from our current dystopia.

Very few people are going to adopt Bitcoin for altruistic reasons or to support some idealistic vision of bringing about a less violent world, the vast majority of Earth's population will be dragged along, many of them kicking in screaming. Hyper-bitcoinization will create a situation of irresistible economic coercion. Simply put, it will be a stampede. Everyone (eventually including governments) will divest from national fiat and invest in Bitcoin because every other currency is going to be relatively worthless in the not too distant future.

Bitcoin uses the logic of capitalism insidiously against itself just as capitalism insidiously twists both culture (ritual) and (pseudo)science (economics) to serve the interests of the elite. In other words, you have no choice but to capitulate. You only get to decide how much wealth you bleed out before capitulation.

But isn't human nature the reason capitalism sucks? In short, no. Capitalism is a system of distributing goods and resources built largely on 18th century economic mythology / pseudoscience, with a bunch of ritual layered on top. There were no special flaws in human nature that spawned capitalism in the first place, it's just a system that was engineered over three hundred years ago. It was created by people who thought slavery was ethically A-okay.

They did the best they could, in fact the transition from feudalism to capitalism was at the time a major net good - the beginning of a more compassionate and far less wasteful system for distributing goods and resources. They just weren't anywhere near as good at systems-engineering or ethics as we modern folk are today. No one has ever successfully dismantled this system and tried to build a better, more compassionate one.

It's a proud tradition of organized capitalists to crush any viable alternatives before they have a chance to take root. Unfortunately for the capitalist masters of the universe, violence is completely ineffective as a leveraging tool on the Blockchain. For the first time in history, a peaceful revolution is possible. Essentially, for the first time in history, we can just walk away.

For the past three hundred years, all we've done is add layer after layer of complexity to an ancient and antiquated system until you get what we have today: a hideously over-engineered system collapsing under its own weight. Bitcoin is a wrench in the gears of a very old, very complex, and very fragile machine.  Capitalism is now a dead thing walking.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kpd24h/the_financial_singularity_theory_how_bitcoin/","The Financial Singularity theory: How Bitcoin swallows the world, and ultimately breaks capitalism","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609646032","","{}","Bitcoin","2","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kpd24h/the_financial_singularity_theory_how_bitcoin/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","Halfhand84","t3_kpd24h","","0","False","kpd24h","50","","","False"

"","","I'm new around here, but this goes for any appreciating asset. If you are in the U.S., don't sell your BTC to pay off a mortgage or even pay outright for property. Here's why. 

Interest rates are historically low - your mortgage debt is likely to be an asset once rates start going back up. For every $100K in mortgage debt, every additional % point is another $20K in total paid. So if you have a $300K mortgage at 3% and interest rates go up to 4%, the total cost for life of the 3% loan will be $60K less. There is a good chance this differential can become an asset in itself. 
 
And just as important - YOU NEVER OWN PROPERTY OUTRIGHT. You have to pay property taxes, and with the debt the government is piling up right now don't be surprised to see those rates increase. The less capital you have sunk into the asset the greater flexibility you will have should there be significant overreach or other issues (civil unrest, etc). In the meantime, your BTC is completely portable. 

At this point, the only thing I would consider cashing in for is:

1. Temporary mortgage payments if you lost a job 
2. To make a down-payment on a property - the minimum possible. And if with that, you can't afford the mortgage payment, then YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY. You MUST figure out a way to get cash-flow, otherwise there is a high likelihood you will fuck up and wind up losing your investment. 
3. Partial payment on a cash-flowing investment - but only if I already had experience in the field with similar successful cash-flowing investments. 

If you are holding significant Bitcoin right now (and sadly I am not), you have an opportunity to build generational wealth. Please don't squander this gift.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kplf1b/please_dont_sell_to_pay_off_debt/","Please don't sell to pay off debt","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609683838","","{}","Bitcoin","0","1609684019.0","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kplf1b/please_dont_sell_to_pay_off_debt/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","Dude-bruh","t3_kplf1b","","0","False","kplf1b","18","","","False"

"","","Hey guys. I know this will sound weird but I bought some bitcoin (on Krakren) in the beginning of 2020 before even really know what this was ahaha, first buy than learn. 
Of course I'm amazed with the profits but I don't want to sell it and I want to accumulate some more. I did some trading on Bybit, lost some, got back what I've lost, but trading with leverage makes me anxious (maybe for unexperience). 
I've been researching and DCA seems the right strategy for me to get more bitcoin. 
So, question no. 1:
 What exchange do you recommend (Fees+Security)? 

Question no.2:
  How stupid is to open a low leverage position (2/3 x)  with an high percentage of my bitcoin, for the long term?

Also how's it work buying on cc? I get 2% cash back on everything would that offset me to be cheaper than bank transfers?

"","","Yesterday the price of bitcoin fell for a couple of minutes and then regained it's price before the fall. I started reading why this could have happend and found something about whales and traders. I don't have the time to time to trade actively so I'm in it for the hodl but I want to learn about btc and these phenomenons.

So if I understood correctly, multiple people or coorperates or whoever that own a large chunk of btc (so called whales) sell at price X, make the price drop for a short time and then buy again at low price to profit. Is this kinda correct? And is it only for profit or is there a larger picture? Why do whales do this because it makes to sense to me only profit wise.. I read something about leveraged longs and shorts but I'm too new for this. Need more research but thought maybe people here could help out.

Now I was also wondering, is there a way of knowing when these so called whales do this? I was lucky to sell just  efore the fall and bought back a little higher then the lowest point but this was luck and because I had my own scheme for what could work for me.. But with this strategy I will lose in the long run, I think. Could you anticipate to this?

I am just curious and want to learn more about these terms, btc and why these things happen.

They all heard me but I was incapable of persuade them... At the same time, I didn't want them to think I need them to invest unless they really want to so they don't mistake this lifetime opportunity with a bubble or Ponzi.

It's amazing the shift that happened and the fact that now, the ones that are still around, ask me for financial advice and call me every time there's a new ATH (phone has been busy!). 

The only advice I give them is the one I'm able to give because it's the only one I truly understand. And it's exactly the same I gave them years ago...

Can someone clarify how GBTC stock price affects underlying bitcoin holdings? 

Hypothetically, if company A somehow held 50% of all GBTC shares and sold it, does that mean the company sells all the equivalent bitcoin at the same time (i.e. 1/2 x 546k bitcoins it holds as of mid December)? How does this work with the 'locking' mechanism (where bitcoins are locked up for 6 months after an institutional investment)?

"","","Right now it's extremely difficult to do that since new bitcoins are mined every day, but think in the long run


The only way for bitcoin to work is for us to be able to spend it and earn it 


What if all businesses work with the same model as in they can receive payment and sell their products and services for bitcoin but will not pay their employees with it... 


even the hodlers eventually, when the price no longer rises and stabilises at a certain point, either have to spend it or convert it to fiat and with diminishing ways to earn it or buy it, bitcoin will slowly disappear from the general public, even the miners might get the option to pay their electricity fees at a discount in bitcoin to stop it from getting sold, or maybe even take over the majority hash rate NOT to attack the network but merely to monopolize the transaction fees, then the bitcoin flow will be cut even more


will the governments order employers to pay their workers in bitcoin and not their national fiat currency that they have complete control of?


but the government is for the people so they have to listen right? right? not really but even if they did, guess what happens next....


paypal, yup crypto banks that holds bitcoin for you but they're not yours, but don't worry, trust us and your money is safe, you can buy, hold and sell and even get paid in crypto yay!!! but you can't get it out from our system cuz national security and terrorists and so on, look what happens at 8/11/21XX a repeat of 9/11/2001 but bitcoin funded them...


crypto banks now control the price of bitcoin but again inflation, and like slowly boiling a frog the general public won't notice and won't care and the very purpose of bitcoin is gone like that, of course we will be able to benefit from it and use it as intended for the next coming decades but you never know what the future holds, this is only one the many scenarios that might happen, maybe governments aren't really that evil 


now for the people who are wondering how i came to this probable scenario, it's the simple curiosity for the term 'bitcoin marxist', so i went and looked up marxism until i fell into 4 youtube videos from 2016 but the thing that clicked for me the most was not marxism but capitalism's ability to adapt, you'll have to watch all 4 videos first to truly get what im trying to say but listening from https://youtu.be/mBcW_ylIN14?t=123 and in 2:32 because it wasn't easy to do the usual capitalist safety measures, that's where they removed the gold standard and went on inflation in earnest 


again just a scenario and maybe i don't know what im talking about...","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kpvn6u/i_think_i_just_found_a_big_bitcoin_problem_what/","I think i just found a big bitcoin problem, What if the rich and powerful decide to use bitcoin as their store of value?

"","","**Inspired by the recent ""My Bitcoin Stories"" and Andreas Antonopolous' lectures. Forgive any poor punctuation, spelling errors or inconsistencies I'm stuck inside with snow and a howling dog. Just a little love story to the Hodlers.**

He always had the last laugh, Jody would say. That was Matt's first thought when he saw the nurse rushing up behind him in the reflection of the hospital doors. He knew what she had to say before they'd opened. Her voice saying ""Mr. Ryan?"" and the cold and noise of the winter rain hitting his face at the same moment. It was just like dad to wait, to catch him by surprise. It was just like dad to be stubborn. Later he would think maybe he'd subconsciously heard the PA announce a code blue. But in their heart of hearts he knew dad just had show him up one last time. Leaving a dying man was a bet that he would live until morning. Dad loved to win bets.

Jody showed up first, then Melanie, Matt's wife. They were supposed to be discussing his funerary arrangements, his personal possessions in the room and so on. Matt just looked in his lap. Melanie was quiet and warmly supportive as usual. Jody was the first to speak,

""I wish he'd let us take him home,"" she said.

""He didn't want to burden us.""

""But to die in a place like this. He could have done better, he could have saved something, or we could have taken care of him..."" 

""I'll call the funeral home in the morning,"" Matt cut her off. They'd been through it before and he'd liked to have let Jody have a good cry. They could both have used it. But if she started she'd never stop.

An orderly interrupted the conversation with a quiet, ""Mr. Taylor?"" He had a form to sign. Remission of personal belongings. A manilla envelope and a small canvas bag. Matt signed and looked in the bag. Clothes. In case dad had walked out. Fat chance. Who ever does? He couldn't stop looking. Jody took the envelope and opened it. She retrieved a locket, their mom's at one time. She squeezed the little latch, the gold heart opening to reveal a picture of her on one side and Matt on the other. They squeezed each others' hands, lips pursed, nodded.

\\---

Matt looked out the window, Melanie driving their workhorse Subaru. They couldn't agree on whether to upgrade, save or pay down debt and it still ran so the driver dealt with the sticky clutch and the passenger dealt with the imperfect weather stripping and life went on. Matt was holding his father's wedding ring in his hand. He was preparing himself to put it on. He knew it would mean something if it fit, he knew it'd mean something if it didn't and he didn't know which he wanted more.

In the envelope presented by the orderly had been only a few things. Dad's wallet, his wedding ring mom's wedding ring, his wristwatch (stopped) and a letter, sealed. The rings were absolutely dad's prized possessions and he'd always said they were worth more than anything else he'd ever owned or would ever own again. They were how he'd convinced his their mom to marry him. Every day working at the grocery, from the first day she started working, he'd leave his desk in the manager's office and pass her register and ask her to lunch and every day she said no. ""Until I said yes,"" she'd interrupt and take up the story with a smile. ""It was that same smile she'd give when she said no that told me she'd say yes,"" dad would say.

Matt was seeing the scene play out in the dark and wet outside the window. They'd have lunch together every day and every day from that first lunch he'd ask, ""So when will we get married?"" and she would reply every time, ""Never, David Taylor, I won't be married to a grocery store assistant manager."" One day when he asked he showed her the ring he'd bought for her. ""Well how about just engaged, then?"" They were sitting side by side on a parking barrier watching the park beyond. Then they were looking at each other over each other's shoulders. Dad doing his terrible approximation of a charming smile, Mom totally falling for it. She took the ring and put it on and said, ""Oh no am I really going to be Mrs. Layla Taylor?"" and kissed dad through his laughter. But he wouldn't stop laughing.

""And just what is so funny?"" she asked.

""Well, you're not going to be Layla Taylor, you already are."" he said. David had a weird sense of humor.

""Oh is that right?""

""Yup! I knew I only had one shot at you saying yes, and you know on my salary I couldn't afford four rings so I had the engagement and wedding rings made together.""

""That is not how that works,"" Layla half laughed, eyebrows furrowed, ""And we are done with our lunch break.""

""Sure it is. I was going to get you a silver engagement ring and gold wedding rings but instead I had our rings made of electrum - half silver and half gold. I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor you're stuck with me.""

""Maybe it's you who's stuck with me, Mr. Taylor. Or maybe I'll make you take my last name.""

""David Davis? You couldn't be so cruel. I'm not a Marvel superhero!""

""Mr. David Davis will see you now, welcome to Keating's Heating and Leon's Freon."" And they laughed all the way back to the grocery. They laughed every day after for forty years.

\\---

Jody and Matt met the next day at David's house. They'd agreed to sell it but it needed some sprucing up and they'd just never gotten around to it. They'd both been hassling him about it for years but if it was one thing Dad was good at it was not listening to his kids. They'd teased him for years whenever they wanted to make a point, ""OK, don't listen to me now, just like you didn't listen in 2023 when I told you to buy Bitcoin,"" or, ""Sure, don't listen to me now, just like I told you that buying a Chinese electric car was a bad idea,"" or, ""Sure, don't listen now like you refused to switch to solar for ten years until they stopped handing out grants.""

""The table, the couches... all the furniture has got to go. The wallpaper, that stove should be replaced. Who didn't go induction? Just Mom and Dad.""

""Jody, where will the money for all this come from?""

""The stager said if we do what she listed we'll get a lot more, faster, for the old place.""

""Yeah - but where will the money come from?""

""It's an investment."" She dragged out the word, especially the S.

""Yeah, but...""

""... Where will the money come from. It's not that much in the long run and if we can sell the house quick then it'll...""

""Uh huh so we fix it up then we have to worry about selling fast and end up taking a low offer. Come on, Jody. As is. Be done with it."" There was a pause. ""I see you're wearing Mom's ring.""

""I see you're wearing Dad's.""

They sat at the kitchen table, styrofoam cups of coffee between them. ""I guess we both remember how they always said they never worried when they thought about their wed-gagement rings. I'll take mine off sometime. I always sort of mean to put it away somewhere,"" Matt said.

""Yeah, me too. Oh, that reminds me, I opened that letter. It was sweet."" She passed it to Matt who pulled it from the envelope, opened it and read it. It was handwritten very neatly.

&gt;Kids,  
&gt;  
&gt;I know you're not kids anymore or I hope you aren't. I know no matter how old you are when you read this that you'll always be kids to me. You're both snoring in your rooms right now and I'm sat in the kitchen with Mom. We both love you very much and we wish we could give you easier lives, but as it is what we can do is provide for now and try to teach you to provide for yourselves in the future. There's no such thing as true security in this world but seeing you sleep soundly in your beds I know we've helped you feel as safe and secure as you deserve. When you read this your mom and I will both be gone but we'll have done our best for you and we want you two to do your best for yourselves and each other. You're going to have to take care of one another. You're going to have to be partners. David, I want you to have my wedding ring. Jody, Mom wants you to have hers. Don't worry if they don't fit, just don't sell them or lose them. They mean more than you know.  
&gt;  
&gt;David, your Mom said I should listen to you more. I am taking her advice. Every week, from now on.  
&gt;  
&gt;\\- Dad  
&gt;  
&gt;June 2023

""Guess we read his mind, huh?"" Jody said, spinning their mom's ring on her finger.

""Yeah, but what about listening to me? Guess he forgot?"" They both laughed. Just briefly. ""One thing about dad, he did like to write. I never saw it before, but his ring has a pretty long inscription inside. Can barely make it out.""

""Yeah, Mom's too. But you didn't know? Mom said they had them engraved when we were little kids to remind them of our future. I should get a magnifying glass or something.""

\\---

The reading of the will was rather brief. David didn't have much. He left the house to the kids, jointly. Thank god it was paid off. He left his Camaro to Jody's son, ""When he can handle it and if he waxes it,"" and everything else he also split between Jody and Matt, ""Including,"" he'd written in his typical romantic joking fashion, ""my true treasure and wealth which is entirely in electrum and always close at hand. My dear children, I hope you listen to me as closely as I've listened to you.""

\\---

Three weeks later the house was clean, painted, staged and ready for showing. Matt had the feeling of putting a ballgown on a corpse. The realtor walked up, admiring the new paint and trimmed shrubs.

""Hope you don't mind I brought you the mail from the mailbox.""

""Oh good, bills,"" Matt said and rifled through them. ""Wait, there must be a mistake. This is the right address but this... and this. All these? They're from that Bitcoin utility and trust company that only accepts Bitcoin. Mom and Dad never had any."" David opened the electric bill. Dear 213 Persimmon Dr., your electricity bill has been paid from the BTC address provided. Your balance is  ‚Çø0.0. Thank you for your continued loyalty. Remember, to keep your electric bill from going to the moon turn off your lights at night... Matt opened another. Dear 213 Persimmon Dr., your taxes have been paid from the BTC address provided. If your owner disputes the calculated amount they can contact... Dear Mr. Taylor, estate of, your vacation property is awaiting claim. There is ‚Çø3 remaining in your rental account. At the time of this writing that balance will be exhausted in 1,845 months... Dear \\^Mr. \\^\\^Taylor...

Matt awoke to Jody's husband standing over him, fanning his face with a newspaper. His eyes focused, he could see Jody beyond, reading the envelopes. He heard her ask if Dad had a secret second family or something. What the heck was going on? Jody knelt by Matt, holding his hand in hers and helped him sit up. David took his turn with the mail. ""Jesus,"" he said, ""The old man was sophisticated enough to keep Bitcoin and savvy enough to keep it secret and he still got *paper* bills?"" Jody's contribution was, ""Oh, shut up, Harold! Matt, you need some water? Harold get him some water.""

When Harold returned with the water he had his cellphone out. His mouth was agape. Matt was reaching for the water but Harold drank it all in one gulp, stammered apologetically and went to get more. When he came back he gave Jody his phone. She looked from the phone to one of the account statements then back to the phone again and again.

She looked at Harold, he nodded. She showed Matt the phone. He couldn't make out the address completely, just the number of BTC. In a daze Matt took out his phone and called home. His daughter answered. ""Honey,"" he said, ""Go get Grampa's ring from my night table and tell me how many words are written inside.""","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kpvjt3/he_never_listened/","""He Never Listened""","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609715747","redditor for a day","{}","Bitcoin","1","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kpvjt3/he_never_listened/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","BitcoinTales","t3_kpvjt3","","0","False","kpvjt3","0","noob","","False"

"","","Hey all,

Not sure if I am allowed to post this here but I had some free time this weekend and thought why not create a silly website to track bitcoin moon price target: [https://whenmoon.lol/](https://whenmoon.lol/)

Thought I would share this with the community.

With our proprietary algorithm, we calculate target moon price and difference in that price. Nah just kidding lol, I am basing my calculations off of distance from earth to moon where 1 mile = 1 usd. Website updates in real-time.

I've been using it as a screensaver when my computer is idle (open a browser window and full screen). It updates prices in real time so it's fun to take a glance at every now and then. If you have any suggestions feel free to let me know. Always looking to improve!

"","","You should answer ‚Äòtechnology‚Äô when people ask what supports BTC. Your ownership in BTC is your stake in the worlds supercomputer.  

The current BTC hash rate is at 140 exahash per second. The fastest supercomputer (Japan‚Äôs Fugaku) is at 0.4 exahash per second.

The saddle has been bolted to the horse. 
The mining facilities have already been built.  
The BTC network has left the competition in the dust.

A SHA-256 coin will serve as the reserve currency (at least until the final btc is mined in 2140). Globalization is here. Universal currency will follow.

I will sell my BTC at 400k usd (aka iou). BCH at 4k.

"","","Bitcoin seems so great, but the low transaction speed is a thorn in its side.

It is not a big problem, as bitcoin doesn't need to get faster to be successful, it already is and will continue to be.

But it can be better, and it'll be adopted by millions if it could be used in everyday transactions viably, and would put the nail in the coffin of our current system.

I've heard and learnt about the lightning network, but a lot of people call it a failure, and say it'll never work. Why hasn't it worked? and will we ever find a way to increase bitcoin's own transaction speed?

and are there any proposed alternative solutions offered that could be a viable way to fix bitcoins transaction speed?

&amp;nbsp;

I've heard people mention that altcoins can be used as a sort of 'silver to the gold that is bitcoin'. I understand that, and even people saying Bitcoin Cash will take over once Bitcoin has become mainstream adopted enough for people to switch to a better alternative. That's fine, as we will decide in the future by committee which coin will be our money. It's all speculation right now.

But I exactly just want to know what limits BTC from just being sped up, and improved, if the code is open-source and mainstream adoption will incentivise everybody to work and improve on bitcoin

I'm turning into a bitcoin maximalists, and I irrationally love this coin over others, and I hope other do too, and so if Bitcoin is gonna be the future's money. I would like it to be faster and viably able to spend and live on it.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kptxsq/can_the_scalability_issue_ever_be_solved_what_are/","Can the scalability issue ever be solved?

"","","As China telecoms are being delisted from the NYSE, I feel especially grateful for Bitcoin‚Äôs autonomy. I know that the US government can and may ultimately regulate BTC in a way that thwarts institutional investment, but the Bitcoin network would still live on and thrive despite regulatory setbacks. 

I know it is my own fault, but I will be paying dearly for holding onto my China ADRs. I may no longer be allowed to hold or trade NYSE: CHL after Jan. 11th, but at least my BTC can‚Äôt be pried away from me as easily. 

Freedom isn‚Äôt free, but the Bitcoin community is fighting the good fight. I‚Äôm not anti-tax or anti-regulation, but this is my first (very, very minor) taste of feeling robbed by my own government. I hope that Bitcoin can serve as a freeing asset for people subject to the truly evil and corrupt governments around the world and ultimately free us from the biggest shortcomings of what we call ‚Äúhuman nature.‚Äù

"",""," Throwaway for privacy,

I just had quite a stressful experience transferring some funds from a paper wallet to an exchange.

I‚Äôve written the story below share my experience to help any others in the same situation. And perhaps improve the user experience.

I used the android Mycelium wallet as it has been around for years and had good reputation years ago. 

I was using blockchain.info but it seems the paper wallet functionality has been completely broken by updates.

After scanning an encrypted paper wallet (bip38), I chose to send 2.5BTC of the 4.3BTC to an exchange.

I quickly received the funds but notice that the transaction showed:

2.64 from paper-wallet transferred to 2.5 (exchange) AND 0.14 to  a new address starting with 3LUkfjs....

 

This is when I started to panic and suspected Mycelium had become illegitimate.

(there is a lot of adds and banners bloating the app)

I was convinced it had skimmed some of my transaction into another address.

After several frustrating attempts at importing the encrypted key in another wallet to get the remaining 1.66BTC, I finally got them out of the (potentially compromised) paper wallet using an old version of [bitaddress.org](https://bitaddress.org/) and Electrum in windows.

This whole time I was rushing and disregarding some normal security protocols in an attempt the get the funds off before any malicious actor might.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After a stressful hour, I discovered that when importing a bip38 private key Mycelium lists 3: addresses that the key corresponds to.

When I did a partial spend. the 0.14BTC was sent to this other address (3LUkfjs‚Ä¶)

I was able to re-scan the paper wallet with Mycelium and spend the 0.14 from 3LUkfjs‚Ä¶

All in all, it was a very stressful experience and I did a number of risky things in my panic.  
 I considered myself fairly knowledgeable in bitcoin and yet this still happened. 

Hopefully this experience is helpful to others, take what you want from it.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko7ss9/story_long_term_holder_was_convinced_i_just_had/","Story: Long Term Holder, Was convinced I just had 0.13 BTC Stolen by Mycelium","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609488726","redditor for a day","{}","Bitcoin","10","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko7ss9/story_long_term_holder_was_convinced_i_just_had/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","throwaaybtcmycelium","t3_ko7ss9","","0","False","ko7ss9","8","noob","","False"

"","","will everyone or atleast in western world use bitcoins for everyday transactions? 

if yes can bitcoin system handle the complex transaction structure of millions of exchange occuring? 

will there be extra fees for low amount of transactions.

suppose one loaf of bread costs 0.00000001BTC will it costs the same or will there be extra fees? 

assuming some people dont use third party exchange but use cold wallet and they do deals like buying a plot of land with other party agrreing in btc payment. How would that transaction be not illegal? wouldnt govt want to be third eye and get its tax share.


one last question, if everyone is saying here to buy bitcoins no matter what and hold. assuming it hits 500k or 1million.whats the point? lets say everyone held their btc and ater started selling. wouldnt price fall down. who would buy it then. even if there is goal why is no one talking about it. satoshi didnt make the system for pump and dump he wanted a currency that isnt centralised yet no major decentralised system other than core itself.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko79qy/will_bitcoin_be_the_future_currency/","Will bitcoin be the future currency?","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609485797","","{}","Bitcoin","8","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko79qy/will_bitcoin_be_the_future_currency/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","anotheravailabledumb","t3_ko79qy","","0","False","ko79qy","8","","","False"

"","","Bitcoin and I go way back in 2010 when I signed up for a meet-up event but cancelled in Toronto. At the time, they were offering to buy some for $90 (if I recall) but I didn't because my thought process was, why am I dropping that amount when Microsoft was only in low 20s, (Note: This was just after America's financial collapse) and what the hell was bitcoin?  Then I signed up to Coinbase 3 years ago but never really did anything because I thought, it was too volatile and the narrative was ""it's only for terrorists and drug dealers.""  
Fast forward to today and Coinbase doesn't allow more than $300 if you're from Canada.  
Is there a reputable exchange that I can trust with my entry purchase?  It's worth more than $300.

"","","I'm posting this here with a throwaway account as I haven't received any fixes on the Wasabi thread. 

So I recently purchased the Coldcard which uses the seeds (all 25words) from my Trezor. When I exported the wallet from Coldcard to a json file and imported it into Wasabi, I can only see the bitcoins from my Trezor Account #1 but not the coins in the other Trezor Accounts #2 and so on. Trezor lets the user create multiple accounts **within the same wallet which is derived from the same seed**. All the addresses are in bech32 already. 

I'm pretty sure this this is a derivation path issue. I.e. Wasabi is able to look at the appropriate derivation path for Trezor account #1 but it doesn't by default look for other accounts which may be using a different derivation path. I'm not sure how to fix this... any suggestions would be appreciated.

"","","If your getting bored sifting through the price posts, heres something to keep you busy till things settle down.  Here's my suggested New Year's reading list to people interested in learning bitcoin.  As you progress you can pickup some C++ and Python and try your hand at contributing.  If you do, read the [contributing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) doc and start there.  Bitcoin's is better than most projects in this regard, they even have a dedicated tag to flag easy issues to solve for noob devs to issue a PR to.

Reading list (in order)

1. [Lopp's Bitcoin Resource Page](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html)
2. [Antonopoulos' Bitcoin Book](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook#reading-this-book)
3. [Lopp's Lightning Resource Page](https://www.lopp.net/lightning-information.html)
4. [Antonopoulos' Lightning Book](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook#status) (about half done)

Since Lopp and Antonopoulos give this info out for free, consider giving them a donation.  You can get their Bitcoin addresses from their following profile pages:

* [Jameson Lopp](https://keybase.io/lopp)
* [Andreas M. Antonopoulos](https://aantonop.com/donate/)

And if that is not deep enough for you

1. [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) (easiest language for most to learn)
2. [GPG Beginners Guide](https://gnupg.org/documentation/index.html) (will teach fundamentals of crypto)
3. [Electrum Manual](https://electrum.org/#documentation) (best SPV wallet)
3. [Electrum Source Code](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/) (easiest for most to understand)
4. [Bitcoin Core v0.1.5](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v0.1.5) (only 20k lines, not difficult at all)
5. [Edward Snowden Book](https://www.overdrive.com/media/4775028/) (Ch 22, 23 and 24 cover ELI5 encryption)

Since the Snowden book has had all the proceeds siezed by the US government, best not buy a copy, it would just be a political donation to the US intelegance community.  You can buy the book internationally, get it from a library (tracked), or pirate it.  If pirated, you can donate to Snowden directly, though that too would likely be flagged.  His legal fund donation address is:

* 3C6qQ&gt;!***\\_\\_\\_REDACTED\\_\\_\\_REDACTED\\_\\_\\_***!&lt;QPfnH &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (redacted, but easy enough to find)

For a PhD, add these to the list:

1. SEC 1 spec from [secg.org](https://www.secg.org/)
1. SEC 2 spec (secp256k1) from [secg.org](https://www.secg.org/)
3. [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
4. [Bitcoin BIP (protocol enhancements)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/README.mediawiki)
5. [Lightning Network whitepaper](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf)

"","","Since there are many people sharing their bitcoin stories, I want to share mine.

I learned about bitcoin from a coworker soon after starting a position at NASA Goddard in early 2017, where worked to manage weather satellite algorithms. He had been using some old GPUs to mine in his basement, and showed me the genesis block, hash functions, and live blockchain transactions as they came over the network. It was clearly a side-project for him, but I began taking my own interest in it when I came home from work.

It was my first job after grad school, and I had just finished setting up my 401K benefits when I decided to buy a little bitcoin as well. I figured that if public markets were theoretically the most intelligently priced, bitcoin must have a lot of potential, because it was the freest market imaginable. This came at a time of living in the DC area and an exposure to national politics and spending time writing a personal novel downtown after work when I didn‚Äôt have many connections. I learned about quantitative easing, fiscal policy, and the move off the gold standard. It further solidified my bitcoin obsession and I wound up on Poloniex from the June 2017 altcoin season. Of course, I was a newbie and lost just as much as I gained. In the end I realized all I cared about was increasing my BTC (and EOS position at the time). Back then it was and still is only a moderate amount.

After that, I held until the end of the year when I sold a bunch of BTC and paid off my car. But all along I knew it was a short term top, so my obsession continued. I ended up leaving my job at NASA to find a blockchain group where I could use my software engineering skills. I did indeed find a healthcare startup, but didn‚Äôt have the web experience to contribute much to the team.

Last year my primarily financial obsession with Bitcoin changed, when I slowly formulated an idea. I was and still am obsessed with blockchain (eosio in particular), and I found some place to feel at peace with the price swings and missed opportunities margin trading.    Applying my knowledge and understanding of climate, I started a company to launch weather balloons in West Africa to collect weather data and reward students with digital currency. I learned about micro-controllers, IoT, web development, and 3D printing and made my prototype ideas a reality. I feel compelled to do this, because I believe there are only a handful of people that have the technical background in weather, software, and climate to found a company like this.

Two months ago a press release by CoinDesk was shared on NASDAQ‚Äôs website.

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/west-african-program-will-store-weather-data-on-telos-blockchain-2020-11-10

Even though my BTC stacks are only moderate, I don‚Äôt feel as though I‚Äôm missing an opportunity by not leveraging long on an exchange, because I see my project as a Call option on crypto in general.

Maybe there‚Äôs someone else out there that feels guilty about not leveraging their own BTC to make even more profit. If that‚Äôs case, I encourage them to get creative and use their own background to improve or change society in one way or another. After all, we all come from different places and can bring something new to the table.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kof350/my_story_from_nasa_to_bitcoin/","My story from NASA to bitcoin","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609522026","","{}","Bitcoin","52","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kof350/my_story_from_nasa_to_bitcoin/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","sunburntcat","t3_kof350","","1","False","kof350","9","","","False"

"","","**Short version:**

Decentralized group of oracles publish PGP public keys, followed after a delay by the corresponding private keys. Bitcoiners can get some physical security by time locking keys needed to spend utxos by encrypting the spend keys to a PGP public key published by the oracle. In order to spend the funds, they must wait for the private key to be published. If a robber asks them to send funds, it is not possible to do so without waiting for the timeout or by some other method that is not attractive for the robber. This is sort of like CLTV, but you can ‚Äúrenew‚Äù the timeout without making an on chain transaction.

---

**Long version:**

As the price of bitcoin goes up, bitcoin holders may worry about their physical security. The best case scenario is when no one knows about the wealth you control, but this may not be achievable for everyone due to exchange data spills, KYC record keeping, tax reporting requirements or other information leaks.

What can you do to protect yourself from the dreaded five dollar wrench attack or hostage ransom attack? A dog and a shotgun are nice to have, but it is fundamentally very difficult to defend yourself from a physical attack from a smart, patient adversary.

It‚Äôs worth noticing that there have been publicly identifiable rich people for a long time, yet robberies and hostage attacks remain infrequent. Unfortunately, Bitcoin has properties that give reason to suspect that physical attacks could be more likely.

1. You do not need to involve or inform any other people to transfer bitcoin to an attacker‚Äôs address. Bitcoin transfers are **private**.

2. You can transfer a fortune in bitcoin within a few minutes. Bitcoin transfers are **fast**.

3. Bitcoin transfers are **irreversible**.

These properties are great to have when you need them, but having all three could be a big liability, if it attracts robbers.

In order to thwart attackers, it would be a good idea to set it up so that you cannot have all three at the same time. For example, you could lock your coins with a script that allows the coins to be spent either with the help of a third party, or no sooner than one year in the future. That way you cannot pay a robber without involving the third party, and if the third party fails you get your coins back at the end of the year.

As a more flexible variation on the above idea, suppose that there were some oracle ‚Äî perhaps a tor hidden service ‚Äî that simply published a PGP public key every day, and then 30 days later it published the corresponding private key. Perhaps it would sell the private key for a fee over the lightning network. Now your coins could be locked with a script that opens two ways:

1. You can spend the coins immediately.

2. You can spend the coins at the end of one year.

Then you encrypt the spend key for Option 1 to the PGP key of the oracle, and delete your unencrypted copies of the spend key. Now the coins are locked for 30 days, until the oracle publishes the PGP private key. Once the PGP private key is published, you could decrypt your spend private key and if you like, you could encrypt it again to a new PGP public key published by the oracle to again lock the coins for 30 days.

---

**Automatic Lock Renewal**

As a method to automatically renew the lock, what you could do is the following.

* Oracle has a list of 30 secrets. It switches to the next secret every day. After the final secret it switches back to the first secret.
* You send a secret to the Oracle, and ask to make a public key.
* The Oracle combines your secret with the Oracle's secret for that day. Oracle uses a secure hash to combine the Oracle secret and your secret. (Let's say the secret is an ECIES private key.)
* The Oracle sends you back the corresponding public key.
* You encrypt your file to the public key and delete the original.
* Now you have to wait until 30 days pass and the Oracle returns to the correct secret, so that you are able to obtain your key. If you do not obtain the secret, the window closes at the end of the day for 30 more days.
* Attacker cannot get your private key from the oracle before robbing you because they do not have your secret.

Keys in the oracle carousel could expire after some number of rotations (e.g. expire after 12 rotations and become accessible every day for some grace period like 1 year so that people can use them to decrypt their files and move them to a different carousel key.)

---

**Additional thoughts:**

* Oracles could publish a PGP public key each day, and make the corresponding private key accessible one year later. If you wanted to lock your coins for a shorter time, just pick an older PGP public key, for example pick one published 335 days ago so that you can get the private key in 30 days.

* For redundancy you could encrypt your private key with PGP keys from several different Oracles.

* Wallets could handle all of this time-locking behind the scenes and simply present the user with a ‚Äúlock coins for x days‚Äù interface.

* Locking can occur on a per-utxo basis, so you could stagger your utxos on the calendar. E.g. you could give yourself access to a different chunk of bitcoin each month for 12 months.

* If you find that you need to sell a bunch of bitcoin, but yours are all locked up, you can always use loans and futures contracts.

* An alternative to CLTV for a backup spend method could be something like an M of N Shamir scheme with shards at several bank deposit boxes, lawyer, etc.

* Oracle‚Äôs could get paid for private keys with lightning, and use lightning capacity as an anti Sybil proof.

* This idea is very private and decentralized. For example, the Oracle has no insight into who uses the service, or how much money is being protected.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kod6h9/key_calendar_for_physical_security/","Key Calendar for Physical Security","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609515465","","{}","Bitcoin","6","1610058040.0","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kod6h9/key_calendar_for_physical_security/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","moral_agent","t3_kod6h9","","0","False","kod6h9","1","","","False"

"",""," Throwaway for privacy,

I just had quite a stressful experience transferring some funds from a paper wallet to an exchange.

I‚Äôve written the story below share my experience to help any others in the same situation. And perhaps improve the user experience.

I used the android Mycelium wallet as it has been around for years and had good reputation years ago. 

I was using blockchain.info but it seems the paper wallet functionality has been completely broken by updates.

After scanning an encrypted paper wallet (bip38), I chose to send 2.5BTC of the 4.3BTC to an exchange.

I quickly received the funds but notice that the transaction showed:

2.64 from paper-wallet transferred to 2.5 (exchange) AND 0.14 to  a new address starting with 3LUkfjs....

 

This is when I started to panic and suspected Mycelium had become illegitimate.

(there is a lot of adds and banners bloating the app)

I was convinced it had skimmed some of my transaction into another address.

After several frustrating attempts at importing the encrypted key in another wallet to get the remaining 1.66BTC, I finally got them out of the (potentially compromised) paper wallet using an old version of [bitaddress.org](https://bitaddress.org/) and Electrum in windows.

This whole time I was rushing and disregarding some normal security protocols in an attempt the get the funds off before any malicious actor might.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After a stressful hour, I discovered that when importing a bip38 private key Mycelium lists 3: addresses that the key corresponds to.

When I did a partial spend. the 0.14BTC was sent to this other address (3LUkfjs‚Ä¶)

I was able to re-scan the paper wallet with Mycelium and spend the 0.14 from 3LUkfjs‚Ä¶

All in all, it was a very stressful experience and I did a number of risky things in my panic.  
 I considered myself fairly knowledgeable in bitcoin and yet this still happened. 

Hopefully this experience is helpful to others, take what you want from it.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko7ss9/story_long_term_holder_was_convinced_i_just_had/","Story: Long Term Holder, Was convinced I just had 0.13 BTC Stolen by Mycelium","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609488726","redditor for a day","{}","Bitcoin","10","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko7ss9/story_long_term_holder_was_convinced_i_just_had/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","throwaaybtcmycelium","t3_ko7ss9","","0","False","ko7ss9","8","noob","","False"

"","","will everyone or atleast in western world use bitcoins for everyday transactions? 

if yes can bitcoin system handle the complex transaction structure of millions of exchange occuring? 

will there be extra fees for low amount of transactions.

suppose one loaf of bread costs 0.00000001BTC will it costs the same or will there be extra fees? 

assuming some people dont use third party exchange but use cold wallet and they do deals like buying a plot of land with other party agrreing in btc payment. How would that transaction be not illegal? wouldnt govt want to be third eye and get its tax share.


one last question, if everyone is saying here to buy bitcoins no matter what and hold. assuming it hits 500k or 1million.whats the point? lets say everyone held their btc and ater started selling. wouldnt price fall down. who would buy it then. even if there is goal why is no one talking about it. satoshi didnt make the system for pump and dump he wanted a currency that isnt centralised yet no major decentralised system other than core itself.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko79qy/will_bitcoin_be_the_future_currency/","Will bitcoin be the future currency?","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609485797","","{}","Bitcoin","8","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ko79qy/will_bitcoin_be_the_future_currency/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","anotheravailabledumb","t3_ko79qy","","0","False","ko79qy","8","","","False"

"","","Bitcoin and I go way back in 2010 when I signed up for a meet-up event but cancelled in Toronto. At the time, they were offering to buy some for $90 (if I recall) but I didn't because my thought process was, why am I dropping that amount when Microsoft was only in low 20s, (Note: This was just after America's financial collapse) and what the hell was bitcoin?  Then I signed up to Coinbase 3 years ago but never really did anything because I thought, it was too volatile and the narrative was ""it's only for terrorists and drug dealers.""  
Fast forward to today and Coinbase doesn't allow more than $300 if you're from Canada.  
Is there a reputable exchange that I can trust with my entry purchase?  It's worth more than $300.

"","","I'm posting this here with a throwaway account as I haven't received any fixes on the Wasabi thread. 

So I recently purchased the Coldcard which uses the seeds (all 25words) from my Trezor. When I exported the wallet from Coldcard to a json file and imported it into Wasabi, I can only see the bitcoins from my Trezor Account #1 but not the coins in the other Trezor Accounts #2 and so on. Trezor lets the user create multiple accounts **within the same wallet which is derived from the same seed**. All the addresses are in bech32 already. 

I'm pretty sure this this is a derivation path issue. I.e. Wasabi is able to look at the appropriate derivation path for Trezor account #1 but it doesn't by default look for other accounts which may be using a different derivation path. I'm not sure how to fix this... any suggestions would be appreciated.

"","","If your getting bored sifting through the price posts, heres something to keep you busy till things settle down.  Here's my suggested New Year's reading list to people interested in learning bitcoin.  As you progress you can pickup some C++ and Python and try your hand at contributing.  If you do, read the [contributing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) doc and start there.  Bitcoin's is better than most projects in this regard, they even have a dedicated tag to flag easy issues to solve for noob devs to issue a PR to.

Reading list (in order)

1. [Lopp's Bitcoin Resource Page](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html)
2. [Antonopoulos' Bitcoin Book](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook#reading-this-book)
3. [Lopp's Lightning Resource Page](https://www.lopp.net/lightning-information.html)
4. [Antonopoulos' Lightning Book](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook#status) (about half done)

Since Lopp and Antonopoulos give this info out for free, consider giving them a donation.  You can get their Bitcoin addresses from their following profile pages:

* [Jameson Lopp](https://keybase.io/lopp)
* [Andreas M. Antonopoulos](https://aantonop.com/donate/)

And if that is not deep enough for you

1. [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) (easiest language for most to learn)
2. [GPG Beginners Guide](https://gnupg.org/documentation/index.html) (will teach fundamentals of crypto)
3. [Electrum Manual](https://electrum.org/#documentation) (best SPV wallet)
3. [Electrum Source Code](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/) (easiest for most to understand)
4. [Bitcoin Core v0.1.5](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v0.1.5) (only 20k lines, not difficult at all)
5. [Edward Snowden Book](https://www.overdrive.com/media/4775028/) (Ch 22, 23 and 24 cover ELI5 encryption)

Since the Snowden book has had all the proceeds siezed by the US government, best not buy a copy, it would just be a political donation to the US intelegance community.  You can buy the book internationally, get it from a library (tracked), or pirate it.  If pirated, you can donate to Snowden directly, though that too would likely be flagged.  His legal fund donation address is:

* 3C6qQ&gt;!***\\_\\_\\_REDACTED\\_\\_\\_REDACTED\\_\\_\\_***!&lt;QPfnH &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (redacted, but easy enough to find)

For a PhD, add these to the list:

1. SEC 1 spec from [secg.org](https://www.secg.org/)
1. SEC 2 spec (secp256k1) from [secg.org](https://www.secg.org/)
3. [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
4. [Bitcoin BIP (protocol enhancements)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/README.mediawiki)
5. [Lightning Network whitepaper](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf)
6. [Lightning Network RFCs (protocol enhancements)](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/00-introduction.md)

"","","Hi guys,

I have researched the topic of securing  bitcoin and I have always heard that once you forget your seed, your bitcoin are gone as well. So if your Trezor spits out your words, you better pay attention.... But now I have heard, that you can Recover your seed, as long as you still have your functioning hardware wallet. I am confused... would it not be overkill to have several copies of your seed or to put it on a metal plate? I mean you would basically have to lose seed and wallet at the same time.

To start off the new year, I was hoping we could get a thread going on the fastest, safest, and easiest way to start investing in bitcoin. A lot of us just received our stimulus, and want to put that money to use and join the the HODL gang.  


Are there easy steps to follow? Any recommended guides that are up to date and safe?

"","","Since there are many people sharing their bitcoin stories, I want to share mine.

I learned about bitcoin from a coworker soon after starting a position at NASA Goddard in early 2017, where worked to manage weather satellite algorithms. He had been using some old GPUs to mine in his basement, and showed me the genesis block, hash functions, and live blockchain transactions as they came over the network. It was clearly a side-project for him, but I began taking my own interest in it when I came home from work.

It was my first job after grad school, and I had just finished setting up my 401K benefits when I decided to buy a little bitcoin as well. I figured that if public markets were theoretically the most intelligently priced, bitcoin must have a lot of potential, because it was the freest market imaginable. This came at a time of living in the DC area and an exposure to national politics and spending time writing a personal novel downtown after work when I didn‚Äôt have many connections. I learned about quantitative easing, fiscal policy, and the move off the gold standard. It further solidified my bitcoin obsession and I wound up on Poloniex from the June 2017 altcoin season. Of course, I was a newbie and lost just as much as I gained. In the end I realized all I cared about was increasing my BTC (and EOS position at the time). Back then it was and still is only a moderate amount.

After that, I held until the end of the year when I sold a bunch of BTC and paid off my car. But all along I knew it was a short term top, so my obsession continued. I ended up leaving my job at NASA to find a blockchain group where I could use my software engineering skills. I did indeed find a healthcare startup, but didn‚Äôt have the web experience to contribute much to the team.

Last year my primarily financial obsession with Bitcoin changed, when I slowly formulated an idea. I was and still am obsessed with blockchain (eosio in particular), and I found some place to feel at peace with the price swings and missed opportunities margin trading.    Applying my knowledge and understanding of climate, I started a company to launch weather balloons in West Africa to collect weather data and reward students with digital currency. I learned about micro-controllers, IoT, web development, and 3D printing and made my prototype ideas a reality. I feel compelled to do this, because I believe there are only a handful of people that have the technical background in weather, software, and climate to found a company like this.

Two months ago a press release by CoinDesk was shared on NASDAQ‚Äôs website.

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/west-african-program-will-store-weather-data-on-telos-blockchain-2020-11-10

Even though my BTC stacks are only moderate, I don‚Äôt feel as though I‚Äôm missing an opportunity by not leveraging long on an exchange, because I see my project as a Call option on crypto in general.

Maybe there‚Äôs someone else out there that feels guilty about not leveraging their own BTC to make even more profit. If that‚Äôs case, I encourage them to get creative and use their own background to improve or change society in one way or another. After all, we all come from different places and can bring something new to the table.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kof350/my_story_from_nasa_to_bitcoin/","My story from NASA to bitcoin","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609522026","","{}","Bitcoin","52","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kof350/my_story_from_nasa_to_bitcoin/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","sunburntcat","t3_kof350","","1","False","kof350","9","","","False"

"","","**Short version:**

Decentralized group of oracles publish PGP public keys, followed after a delay by the corresponding private keys. Bitcoiners can get some physical security by time locking keys needed to spend utxos by encrypting the spend keys to a PGP public key published by the oracle. In order to spend the funds, they must wait for the private key to be published. If a robber asks them to send funds, it is not possible to do so without waiting for the timeout or by some other method that is not attractive for the robber. This is sort of like CLTV, but you can ‚Äúrenew‚Äù the timeout without making an on chain transaction.

---

**Long version:**

As the price of bitcoin goes up, bitcoin holders may worry about their physical security. The best case scenario is when no one knows about the wealth you control, but this may not be achievable for everyone due to exchange data spills, KYC record keeping, tax reporting requirements or other information leaks.

What can you do to protect yourself from the dreaded five dollar wrench attack or hostage ransom attack? A dog and a shotgun are nice to have, but it is fundamentally very difficult to defend yourself from a physical attack from a smart, patient adversary.

It‚Äôs worth noticing that there have been publicly identifiable rich people for a long time, yet robberies and hostage attacks remain infrequent. Unfortunately, Bitcoin has properties that give reason to suspect that physical attacks could be more likely.

1. You do not need to involve or inform any other people to transfer bitcoin to an attacker‚Äôs address. Bitcoin transfers are **private**.

2. You can transfer a fortune in bitcoin within a few minutes. Bitcoin transfers are **fast**.

3. Bitcoin transfers are **irreversible**.

These properties are great to have when you need them, but having all three could be a big liability, if it attracts robbers.

In order to thwart attackers, it would be a good idea to set it up so that you cannot have all three at the same time. For example, you could lock your coins with a script that allows the coins to be spent either with the help of a third party, or no sooner than one year in the future. That way you cannot pay a robber without involving the third party, and if the third party fails you get your coins back at the end of the year.

As a more flexible variation on the above idea, suppose that there were some oracle ‚Äî perhaps a tor hidden service ‚Äî that simply published a PGP public key every day, and then 30 days later it published the corresponding private key. Perhaps it would sell the private key for a fee over the lightning network. Now your coins could be locked with a script that opens two ways:

1. You can spend the coins immediately.

2. You can spend the coins at the end of one year.

Then you encrypt the spend key for Option 1 to the PGP key of the oracle, and delete your unencrypted copies of the spend key. Now the coins are locked for 30 days, until the oracle publishes the PGP private key. Once the PGP private key is published, you could decrypt your spend private key and if you like, you could encrypt it again to a new PGP public key published by the oracle to again lock the coins for 30 days.

---

**Automatic Lock Renewal**

As a method to automatically renew the lock, what you could do is the following.

* Oracle has a list of 30 secrets. It switches to the next secret every day. After the final secret it switches back to the first secret.
* You send a secret to the Oracle, and ask to make a public key.
* The Oracle combines your secret with the Oracle's secret for that day. Oracle uses a secure hash to combine the Oracle secret and your secret. (Let's say the secret is an ECIES private key.)
* The Oracle sends you back the corresponding public key.
* You encrypt your file to the public key and delete the original.
* Now you have to wait until 30 days pass and the Oracle returns to the correct secret, so that you are able to obtain your key. If you do not obtain the secret, the window closes at the end of the day for 30 more days.
* Attacker cannot get your private key from the oracle before robbing you because they do not have your secret.

Keys in the oracle carousel could expire after some number of rotations (e.g. expire after 12 rotations and become accessible every day for some grace period like 1 year so that people can use them to decrypt their files and move them to a different carousel key.)

---

**Additional thoughts:**

* Oracles could publish a PGP public key each day, and make the corresponding private key accessible one year later. If you wanted to lock your coins for a shorter time, just pick an older PGP public key, for example pick one published 335 days ago so that you can get the private key in 30 days.

* For redundancy you could encrypt your private key with PGP keys from several different Oracles.

* Wallets could handle all of this time-locking behind the scenes and simply present the user with a ‚Äúlock coins for x days‚Äù interface.

* Locking can occur on a per-utxo basis, so you could stagger your utxos on the calendar. E.g. you could give yourself access to a different chunk of bitcoin each month for 12 months.

* If you find that you need to sell a bunch of bitcoin, but yours are all locked up, you can always use loans and futures contracts.

* An alternative to CLTV for a backup spend method could be something like an M of N Shamir scheme with shards at several bank deposit boxes, lawyer, etc.

* Oracle‚Äôs could get paid for private keys with lightning, and use lightning capacity as an anti Sybil proof.

* This idea is very private and decentralized. For example, the Oracle has no insight into who uses the service, or how much money is being protected.","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/kod6h9/key_calendar_for_physical_security/","Key Calendar for Physical Security","{}","","self","","self.Bitcoin","False","1609515465","","{}","Bitcoin","6","1610058040.0","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kod6h9/key_calendar_for_physical_security/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","moral_agent","t3_kod6h9","","0","False","kod6h9","1","","","False"

"1","","# Cheap hotel stays

Hi Guys,

I have a little over 5 million IHG points that are going to expire in Dec 24. I am looking to sell these off at 50% of any stay cost.

You find your stay anywhere in the world, for any length of time and what ever the cost I will book it in your name etc at 50% of the price. Looking for payment in crypto as I want to convert them to crypto ultimately but that's not an option. Genuine offer, happy to provide proof and explain how it will work to protect you.

Only stays at IHG resorts are valid - anywhere in the world. You also get all my Diamond Elite perks with the booking.

Thanks

Peter","","","/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ds2702/cheap_hotel_staysholidays_50_off/","Cheap hotel stays/holidays -50% off","{}","0","self","","self.Bitcoin","True","1719756177.0","","{}","Bitcoin","1","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ds2702/cheap_hotel_staysholidays_50_off/","t5_2s3qj","","True","","Rachewls","t3_1ds2702","","0","False","1ds2702","0","","False","False"

On the morning of the 11/06 I tried to contact support to block my account cuamy email was hacked. They have no phone number, so I did it from the online form.

There was no answer from them and the hacker was able to clean my account.
I had 2FA authentication so I still don‚Äôt understand how this happened. In the report that Kraken sent me there is written that there was an access with an unauthorized device but it was all good apparently. I don‚Äôt understand how this is possible‚Ä¶

I received no email about all the activities done by the hacker, and in the report I received from the support, Kraken is saying that they sent everything to the new email I linked to my account after I was robbed (I changed email to be sure).
So I‚Äôt a fake report and they are protecting the scammer basically‚Ä¶

I would like to take legal action against Kraken since they are basically protecting hakers.

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong so please fee free to correct. Now it has been well over 36 hours and usually my transactions are completed in 2-3 hours. If I need this transaction to go through is it best to redo and if so, how can I ensure that the fees are high enough? And the other weird thing is that the bitcoins seem to have left my account.

I recently set up a Strike account in the UK to DCA some Bitcoin. The account was approved and it‚Äôs past the 24hr waiting period. I have also added my bank account, which it says it has successfully accepted. 

When I then go in to the deposit section there is no box to select how much ¬£GBP I want to deposit, only an auto buy Bitcoin toggle switch and the bank details for a bank I‚Äôm not affiliated with (I can only imagine it‚Äôs the bank Strike uses in the UK to receive customer funds).

I have tried deleting my bank details and resubmitting them, but am still having the same problem. I‚Äôve searched elsewhere to try and solve the problem, but can‚Äôt find the answer. 

Can anyone help?

"1","","I see millions of post of people bashing themselves for not buying btc when it was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù ($100,$1,000) almost sounding like they want to off themselves for ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù but truth is if you‚Äôre one of those , it‚Äôs best you don‚Äôt invest at all and live a normal life, normal job and forget crypto exists. Investing in stocks/crypto is mostly taking educated risks and hoping you were right, anyone tells you otherwise is wrong. Nobody knows where a coin/stock is going everyone in it is just hoping to be right. Now for those who regret not buying BTC sooner , I want you to think about what you‚Äôd be telling yourself instead if BTC was just a ‚Äúscam‚Äù and crypto didn‚Äôt go anywhere .. ahaa , gotcha! ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad i didn‚Äôt buying in to that garbage‚Äù .

My point is that emotions can‚Äôt be a factor when investing. Program yourself to not feel anything when you‚Äôre down 40% neither to feel anything when you‚Äôre up 40% think about it as if it‚Äôs just mumbers on a screen that don‚Äôt affect you in anyway because OF COURSE YOU‚ÄôRE ONLY INVESTING WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE so there‚Äôs no reason to want a drink of clorox if your portfolio is down 60%.

Hi Guys,

I have a little over 5 million IHG points that are going to expire in Dec 24. I am looking to sell these off at 50% of any stay cost.

You find your stay anywhere in the world, for any length of time and what ever the cost I will book it in your name etc at 50% of the price. Looking for payment in crypto as I want to convert them to crypto ultimately but that's not an option. Genuine offer, happy to provide proof and explain how it will work to protect you.

Only stays at IHG resorts are valid - anywhere in the world. You also get all my Diamond Elite perks with the booking.

On the morning of the 11/06 I tried to contact support to block my account cuamy email was hacked. They have no phone number, so I did it from the online form.

There was no answer from them and the hacker was able to clean my account.
I had 2FA authentication so I still don‚Äôt understand how this happened. In the report that Kraken sent me there is written that there was an access with an unauthorized device but it was all good apparently. I don‚Äôt understand how this is possible‚Ä¶

I received no email about all the activities done by the hacker, and in the report I received from the support, Kraken is saying that they sent everything to the new email I linked to my account after I was robbed (I changed email to be sure).
So I‚Äôt a fake report and they are protecting the scammer basically‚Ä¶

I would like to take legal action against Kraken since they are basically protecting hakers.

"1","","I‚Äôve read over previous posts but I can‚Äôt seem to find advice on how to fix the problem in the future. I believe the reason my transaction is pending is because the fee was too low. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong so please fee free to correct. Now it has been well over 36 hours and usually my transactions are completed in 2-3 hours. If I need this transaction to go through is it best to redo and if so, how can I ensure that the fees are high enough? And the other weird thing is that the bitcoins seem to have left my account. Thanks for any advice.

"1","","Hi all,

I recently set up a Strike account in the UK to DCA some Bitcoin. The account was approved and it‚Äôs past the 24hr waiting period. I have also added my bank account, which it says it has successfully accepted. 

When I then go in to the deposit section there is no box to select how much ¬£GBP I want to deposit, only an auto buy Bitcoin toggle switch and the bank details for a bank I‚Äôm not affiliated with (I can only imagine it‚Äôs the bank Strike uses in the UK to receive customer funds).

I have tried deleting my bank details and resubmitting them, but am still having the same problem. I‚Äôve searched elsewhere to try and solve the problem, but can‚Äôt find the answer. 

Can anyone help?

"1","","I see millions of post of people bashing themselves for not buying btc when it was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù ($100,$1,000) almost sounding like they want to off themselves for ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù but truth is if you‚Äôre one of those , it‚Äôs best you don‚Äôt invest at all and live a normal life, normal job and forget crypto exists. Investing in stocks/crypto is mostly taking educated risks and hoping you were right, anyone tells you otherwise is wrong. Nobody knows where a coin/stock is going everyone in it is just hoping to be right. Now for those who regret not buying BTC sooner , I want you to think about what you‚Äôd be telling yourself instead if BTC was just a ‚Äúscam‚Äù and crypto didn‚Äôt go anywhere .. ahaa , gotcha! ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad i didn‚Äôt buying in to that garbage‚Äù .

My point is that emotions can‚Äôt be a factor when investing. Program yourself to not feel anything when you‚Äôre down 40% neither to feel anything when you‚Äôre up 40% think about it as if it‚Äôs just mumbers on a screen that don‚Äôt affect you in anyway because OF COURSE YOU‚ÄôRE ONLY INVESTING WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE so there‚Äôs no reason to want a drink of clorox if your portfolio is down 60%.

Hi Guys,

I have a little over 5 million IHG points that are going to expire in Dec 24. I am looking to sell these off at 50% of any stay cost.

You find your stay anywhere in the world, for any length of time and what ever the cost I will book it in your name etc at 50% of the price. Looking for payment in crypto as I want to convert them to crypto ultimately but that's not an option. Genuine offer, happy to provide proof and explain how it will work to protect you.

Only stays at IHG resorts are valid - anywhere in the world. You also get all my Diamond Elite perks with the booking.

Thanks

On the morning of the 11/06 I tried to contact support to block my account cuamy email was hacked. They have no phone number, so I did it from the online form.

There was no answer from them and the hacker was able to clean my account.
I had 2FA authentication so I still don‚Äôt understand how this happened. In the report that Kraken sent me there is written that there was an access with an unauthorized device but it was all good apparently. I don‚Äôt understand how this is possible‚Ä¶

I received no email about all the activities done by the hacker, and in the report I received from the support, Kraken is saying that they sent everything to the new email I linked to my account after I was robbed (I changed email to be sure).
So I‚Äôt a fake report and they are protecting the scammer basically‚Ä¶

I would like to take legal action against Kraken since they are basically protecting hakers.

"1","","I‚Äôve read over previous posts but I can‚Äôt seem to find advice on how to fix the problem in the future. I believe the reason my transaction is pending is because the fee was too low. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong so please fee free to correct. Now it has been well over 36 hours and usually my transactions are completed in 2-3 hours. If I need this transaction to go through is it best to redo and if so, how can I ensure that the fees are high enough? And the other weird thing is that the bitcoins seem to have left my account. Thanks for any advice.

"1","","Hi all,

I recently set up a Strike account in the UK to DCA some Bitcoin. The account was approved and it‚Äôs past the 24hr waiting period. I have also added my bank account, which it says it has successfully accepted. 

When I then go in to the deposit section there is no box to select how much ¬£GBP I want to deposit, only an auto buy Bitcoin toggle switch and the bank details for a bank I‚Äôm not affiliated with (I can only imagine it‚Äôs the bank Strike uses in the UK to receive customer funds).

I have tried deleting my bank details and resubmitting them, but am still having the same problem. I‚Äôve searched elsewhere to try and solve the problem, but can‚Äôt find the answer. 

Can anyone help?

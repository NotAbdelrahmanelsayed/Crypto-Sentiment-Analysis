"","","Before any mods block this here, please consider that getting an answer to this is critically important for the future development path and practicality of crypto currency.

I've been trying to get an answer to this very basic question for a while now.

All of the algorithms which would allow a quantum computer to break encryption depend on working quantum gates.

However, the recent ""quantum supremacy"" breakthroughs don't have them from what I can see.

Quantum computer theory is well developed, but doing anything useful depends on the reality of working quantum logical circuits, and no one seem to have created one. The number of qbits is meaningless unless you can take those entangled bits and manipulate them through logical operations without losing entanglement.

Also, this is not just a matter of technical achievement. From what I can tell, we don't really understand whether manipulating qbits in this way is possible in principle. The theories all assume that it is. But this in turn supposes a particular interpretation of quantum reality, something which has been extremely controversial and hard to pin down for the past one hundred years.

My sense is that the miracle of quantum computation seems a bit like a free lunch, and will only work if the many / infinite worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is literally true. Essentially you are using the infinity of worlds to create an infinite parallel processor. Unless someone has conclusively proven that entangled qbits can be logically manipulated, I remain quite skeptical of the whole business.

Please note that physics has itself been on a 40 year road to nowhere based on assumptions and the fancy math of string theory. So this is far from unprecedented.

Given the billions of dollars being poured into quantum computer research, I find this situation to be rather remarkable.","","FOCUSED-DISCUSSION","/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ko794d/this_question_was_immediately_blocked_on_uphysics/","This question was immediately blocked on u/Physics: Has anyone demonstrated a working quantum gate which can reliably manipulate qbits without losing entanglement?","{}","","self","","self.CryptoCurrency","False","1609485701","Platinum | QC: XMR 221, BTC 73","{}","CryptoCurrency","17","1609486221.0","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ko794d/this_question_was_immediately_blocked_on_uphysics/","t5_2wlj3","","True","","cryptocomicon","t3_ko794d","FOCUSED-DISCUSSION","0","False","ko794d","15","Monero","","False"

"","","Question for Crypto traders!

What’s your favorite app for trading crypto?

I use Robinhood to day trade but they don’t offer any kind of Stop Order for crypto.

I’ve been saying for the last three months that the bubble is going to burst but bought a spread a few weeks back and am already up 30% 

I’d like to be able to place a stop order in case it try’s to drop 90% in the middle of the night.","","SUPPORT","/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ko5rli/trading_question_about_stop_orders/","Trading Question about Stop Orders","{}","","self","","self.CryptoCurrency","False","1609478875","","{}","CryptoCurrency","1","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ko5rli/trading_question_about_stop_orders/","t5_2wlj3","","True","","Grizlore","t3_ko5rli","SUPPORT","0","False","ko5rli","6","","","False"

"","","Hi all. I joined in 2017. Not in crazy november or december, it was somewhere midyear. Ofc I started slowly with bitcoin and ethereum.. but then got tempted by the antshares to neo rally to step into altcoins. I also did a few ICO’s here and there. I still own those altcoins and believe in their products. Maybe naive but well.. one never forgets a first love I guess? Now with all the hype, institutional money and DeFI projects standing tall, I still dont have the heart to sell those altcoins, so I’m still in the red. Am I alone? Sure feels like being alone.

"","","What are yours?

Mine are:

1. No more buying XRP. I liked the tech a lot and thought it had potential but the execs there are about as straight as a Politician. They have lost my favor permanently.

2. Convert another 20% of my assets into Crypto (currently about 10%, up from 5% earlier in the year. 

3. Buy more ETH. Right now I am 50% BTC, 20% ETH, 15% LINK, 15% VET (formerly XRP). I'll prolly trim VET down to 5% and throw that other 10% into ETH. 

That's pretty much it for me.","","FOCUSED-DISCUSSION","/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ko4mro/new_years_crypto_resolutions/","New Years Crypto Resolutions?","{}","","self","","self.CryptoCurrency","False","1609473797"," ","{}","CryptoCurrency","5","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ko4mro/new_years_crypto_resolutions/","t5_2wlj3","","True","","lostweaponryu","t3_ko4mro","FOCUSED-DISCUSSION","0","False","ko4mro","6","Transitioning","","False"

If I'm totally honest with myself, I've neglected some responsibilities this pass year trying to time the market. Spent far too much time looking at charts and reading white papers for new projects. Some might say I was addicted, that's why going forward I'll be limiting myself on how much time I spend on Crypto. 

I've been in crypto for many years now, seen massive gains, and even bigger losses. But one thing that is for sure, crypto isn't going anywhere. So relax, take a break and HODL a loved one.

"","","Recently saw on other subreddits an interest in looking at the stock purchases of congressional members which had me thinking if any congressman have a stake in crypto. 

The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act was pasted in 2012 to stop congressional members from insider trading. Considering this was pasted by themselves I’m sure they have ways of getting around it. I’m very curious to know if any members of Congress have publicly disclosed any purchases of bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency to the public. 

From what I’ve gathered online it seems that in 2018 the house ethics committee released a memo stating that members of Congress must disclose the purchase of any cryptocurrency and that it must be treated like any other security if they hold above 1000 dollars worth of any particular crypto asset. Still I haven’t heard of any particular senator or representative that is publicly known to have a stake in bitcoin or any other crypto asset. 

I’m not entirely sure if this information is already out there and I have no clue where I would have to go to find it but it would be interesting to see if any members of the house or senate have a large stake in crypto. It would also be interesting to see whether or not any of them have bought into it recently during the current bull run.","","POLITICS","/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kof6uw/are_there_any_congressional_members_that_have_a/","Are there any congressional members that have a large stake in cryptocurrency?","{}","","self","","self.CryptoCurrency","False","1609522383"," ","{}","CryptoCurrency","8","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kof6uw/are_there_any_congressional_members_that_have_a/","t5_2wlj3","","True","","corymigs","t3_kof6uw","POLITICS","0","False","kof6uw","28","Transitioning","","False"

[Top Ten 2021 - all systems go!](https://preview.redd.it/42vazcxh3r861.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cb7d68e2687f4ef815eb6a5765c5b3956636b4a)

## The 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment is a go!

For the [fourth New Year's Day in a row](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/), I am happy to announce that I have once again purchased $100 of the Top Ten Cryptocurrencies for 2021.

And the lucky cryptos this year?  Here they are in descending market cap order:

[ Source: CoinMarketCap ](https://preview.redd.it/pobbhikl3r861.png?width=1364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4208e1b6129eaa37a8e439dc2b57790710388974)

That's a $100 investment, $100 each of #1 BTC, #2 ETH, #3 Tether, #4 XRP, #5 LTC, #6 DOT, #7 BCH, #8 ADA, #9 BNB, and #10 LINK.

I used three different exchanges to make the purchases, so the Coin Market Cap screenshot above doesn't reflect the actual prices by the time I pulled the trigger.  Below is what I actually paid:

I used Coinbase Pro to purchase BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH, and LINK at the prices below:

I used Binance to purchase USDT, ADA, and BNB at the prices below:

And Kraken to purchase DOT at the price below:

# Initial observations:

* *Previously on Top Ten Crypto Experiments*: after a **$3000 investment** in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my combined portfolios were worth **$‭5,154**‬ ($435+ $2,432 +$2,287) as of the end of November 2020 - that’s **up about +72%** for the three combined portfolios
* Today's $1k purchase brings the total investment up to $4k since January 2018.
* The 2020 Dropouts:  BitcoinSV, Tezos, and EOS
* The 2021 New Additions: Polkadot, Cardano, and Chainlink
* ADA was in the Top Ten in 2018, took a two-year break, and is now solidly back in the Top Ten.
* The ""Three Year Club"" will be upgraded to the ""Four Year Club"" - this group is comprised of the only Cryptos to be in the Top Ten at the start each of the last four years.  They are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, XRP, and Litecoin

Other than that, it was an, um, interesting experience to buy BTC at over $29k after buying at over $13k three years ago.

# FAQs

**Q: You compare the Top Ten cryptos to the S&amp;P 500.  Wouldn't it be more fair to compare the top ten stocks vs. the top ten cryptos?**

A: I've thought about this quite a bit (monthly actually, for the last three years): what I'm after is a total crypto vs. total stock market comparison. Tracking the Top Ten Cryptos isn't perfect, but they usually make up about 90% of the total market. If I only tracked the Top Ten S&amp;P 500 by weight, I would only be tracking about 22% of the S&amp;P Index. A more fair comparison is the entire S&amp;P 500, which accounts for 75% of the entire US market.

Still imperfect comparing 90% of one thing vs. 75% of another, but still hopefully close enough to be useful.

**Q: You bought Tether?  Why?**

A: I debated back and forth on whether or not to include Tether for the 2019 and 2020 experiments (Tether is not in the 2018 Top Ten). At the end of the day, these are snapshots in time, so like it or not, Tether is in the Top Ten. In some ways, this whole experiment is turning out to be much more of a documentary or picture of a particular time in crypto rather than an investing strategy. 

Plus “Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments Minus Tether Plus Number Eleven” didn’t fit on my business card.

I try to be impartial, but no one gets into crypto for stablecoins. I do look back with fondness (and look forward to a future) when stablecoins aren't in the Top Ten. 

That said, these are exciting times in crypto.  These days you can get some pretty interesting interest rates even on stablecoins, something I may factor in going forward now that I am the proud owner of $300 worth of USDT.  I may do a stablecoin spin off experiment, where I report on different interest bearing platforms (Aave vs. Nexo vs. Celsius, for example).

**Q: Why bother actually buying all of these cryptos?**

A:  I found actually having some skin in the game has been motivating and has helped me to complete and share my monthly updates, even when all seemed dark and hopeless.

**Q: There's got to be an easier way to get exposure to the entire crypto market, right?**

A: Lots of smart people are working on it.  For example, check out what they're working on at [https://cryptex.finance](https://cryptex.finance/)

**Q: How long will you run the experiments/any plans to sell?**  

A: I'm still enjoying the experience, no plans to sell at the moment.

**Q: I hate Coin X, why is it included in the experiment?**

A: If it's in the Top Ten on January 1st, it's in the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment, simple as that.

**Q: What about weighting?  Or rebalancing? Or selling and replacing a Top Ten dropout coin?**

A:  Weighting is interesting, but to be beginner friendly, I went for an even 10% allocation when I started three years ago and have kept it up for consistency's sake. Weighting would also lead to the rebalancing question, which is a bit advanced for this experiment.  Plus with only $100 investments, fees would eat me alive.  Similar to selling dropouts and buying ascending coins.  There's so much movement in crypto, not worth the fees.

# The first monthly report for the 2021 Top Ten group will drop in early February - and the 2018, 2019, and 2020 will be released in the coming weeks.

In the meantime, you're welcome to pour through all the monthly data here: https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/

"","","So I’ve only ever held coins and and just now trying to get into the space of trading. 
My question is, do you guys trade to a stable coin between trades, or just trade btc or eth for whatever alt then back to btc or eth.

I recognize this is fairly elementary, but I can’t find a straight answer anywhere.

"","","I have too many different audio notifications on my phone for different apps.  Sometimes, I'm confused when I hear a notification to know if it's coming from SMS, Signal, Reddit, Email, etc.  I thought of a silly solution last night when quietly celebrating the New Year at home.

I want a specific notification sound for Reddit.  I will trade Moons for someone who can make it happen.

Many of you probably know the sound that a bullfrog makes, I think?  Sort of a deep sounding ""Ribbit"" noise.  I assume there are some audio editors here that could find a good quality recording of a bullfrog's ""ribbit"" noise and then overlay a deep male voice saying ""reddit"" on top, so it sounds like a bullfrog saying reddit.

I will give 1500 Moons to someone who can produce the best sound to imitate what I'm envisioning.  I would also like it shared publicly here (not in a DM) so all other redditors can use the sound if they want.

If anyone can create this sound and post it here, I will let other redditors help judge the winner.  I'll put January 15th as a deadline, and the sound with the most upvotes on that day gets the 1500 Moons.  Or if the top two sounds are within 10% of each other for total votes, I'll split it as 750 Moons each.

Ideally the sound should be quite short, only about a second long, and in high quality and at normal full volume.

Thanks for your interest!

**EDIT:  It just turned past midnight on January 15th (my local time) and I'm now declaring** /u/ConfidenceNo2598 **as the winner of this contest.  I just transferred 1500 Moons to his vault.  Congratulations, and here's the link to the winning entry:**

"","","When I select to connect a hardware wallet to my Metamask I have the ability to find my wallet via ""Ledger Live"" or ""Legacy/Mew""

I can not find my Metamask account that I am currently using when I select ""Legacy/Mew""

it just shows an infinite number of accounts with 0.000000 ETH

I am wondering why the account that I'm logged into and literally using is not showing up as an account I can connect my hardware wallet to.

Maybe it cant use this specific metamask account because I'm using this account to provide liquidity on AAVE/Uniswap?

"","","So there’s this project called aelf that kinda launched 3 years ago. The team has pushed a lot of updates and mainnet went live 3 weeks ago. The first side chain just went live on the mainnet and the token swap is coming up. The catch? It has made a new ATL in ELF/BTC.

Any ideas as to why a project that uses to be hovering rank 85 is now slipping below 140, even after mainnet and side chain?

My guess is that the name is stupid, the logo is horrible, and the CEO doesn’t speak English.","","FOCUSED-DISCUSSION","/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kop7l6/aelf_an_elfant_in_the_room/","Aelf: An ELFant in the room","{}","","self","","self.CryptoCurrency","False","1609555894","","{}","CryptoCurrency","1","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kop7l6/aelf_an_elfant_in_the_room/","t5_2wlj3","","True","","[deleted]","t3_kop7l6","FOCUSED-DISCUSSION","0","False","kop7l6","3","","","False"

"","","I was looking at my airline reward points today and thinking how I almost definitely won't be using them for travel this year. I poked around to see what else I could exchange the points for, and I found a couple of prepaid credit card options. The value for the prepaid credit cards vs. using points for flights isn't great, but I'm betting the increased value in my crypto holdings through the year will make that a moot point.

Most will go into BTC and ETH. What's your favourite alt/shit coin that I should add to my portfolio?

"","","Hey fellow coiners!

tl;dr: looking for a portfolio tracker that allows distinct sourced imports so I can track my stacks scattered all over the place.

Last couple of months I started throwing some coins into different services and wallets as a way to test alternate setups and to benefit from some diversification as well. Now it's quite time consuming to check each one's balance and make some analytical statistics as to validate premisses and performance.

So I'm looking for a portfolio tracker that allows the tracking of the following balances:
- major exchanges;
- networks as Nexo and Celsius;
- wallets as exodus and coinomi
- wallet addresses from paper wallets
- hardware wallet as trezor

I've already tried some trackers such as Delta and Blockfolio for mobile and Cointracker, Cryptocompare and some others I can't quite remember now.

The one that come closer was the oldie cointracker, but with no mobile app for it I'll say it's a soft no.

So, how do you thick-skinned, all-weather impervious hodlers track your stack?","","FINANCE","/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/komibs/comprehensive_stack_tracker_app/","Comprehensive Stack tracker app","{}","","self","","self.CryptoCurrency","False","1609546327","Gold | QC: CC 69","{}","CryptoCurrency","2","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/komibs/comprehensive_stack_tracker_app/","t5_2wlj3","","True","","debrus","t3_komibs","FINANCE","0","False","komibs","1","","","False"

"","","With Bitcoin hitting all time highs as we transition into 2021, I wanted to share my “Bitcoin ruined my relationship” story with you guys. Maybe you will appreciate it, at least.

I met a woman in early 2017 while taking post-graduate classes. While I admit I was a bit apprehensive of her at first, over time she warmed on me—until she simply became my best fucking friend on earth. You know what it’s like when someone totally accepts you, and loves you, and wants to spend every second with you. 

Yes, it was like that. 

And any man or woman alive who has also had this knows exactly how it makes you feel. It’s like the world is covering you kisses. It feels like god is rubbing your tummy. People who love you like this can be a grounding force in your life, and something about our connection just made me feel so alive, giving me strength at times I simply couldn’t have found anywhere else. There just something magic about having someone you can’t wait to go home and share your day with. 

And I had that. We had that. 

But my girlfriend was so stressed. Holy shit, she was so stressed. About what? Money. Money, man. Dear god, her anxiety would sing like siren. And I got it, loud and clear. 

Forgive me, this is going to be a long story. 

You see I grew up pretty poor, as did she. But at some point in her life she had married up into the Nordstrom family. Yes. That Nordstrom. 

As you can imagine, going from growing up in a small rural home with a barn to traveling in private planes is quite the life upgrade. I don’t want to share too much about the details of this relationship, but suffice it to say she managed to get her three kids through college, which was literally all she wanted. 

When I met her, she was exhausted. In process of divorce. The marriage, even with all the wealth, the Ferrari’s, the vineyards, etc—it just wasn’t worth it to her anymore. She often said she just felt like just rolling over and dying once all her children grew up and moved on. Empty nest syndrome. For real. 

And that’s about the time we met.

The journey of falling in love with someone happens slowly—but brilliantly. At first it was just us talking after classes. And then it was car rides. And then she was hanging out at my house, and I hers. And then over the months, we just absolutely fell in love. I mean we LOVED each other. And we went everywhere together, did amazing things. I loved her kids and her other family, and she loved mine. Loved to travel. Loved to go out in nature together. Loved to take mushrooms and ecstasy and stay up all night having sex. It was AMAZING. I was finally safe and at home. It felt like my life was **finally** coming together. 

But then the panic set in as she was finalizing the divorce. She was only going to walk away with $800,000. Now I know that $800,000 is a LOT OF FUCKING MONEY. A LOT. It’s more than I have right now. But when you are divorcing someone whose net worth is $65m, $800k after seven years of marriage is pretty slim pickings. Ultimately though, it means you are still going to have to work. It means you aren’t able to just, well, spend at any moment anymore.  And that means change. 

You can be as critical as you want of how easy rich people have it, but I promise you, that going from a life of NEVER having to worry about money, back to having to worry about money again—it’s fucking painful, guys. Really painful. And I understood this on some level (because my dumbass sold my a large portion of my bitcoin at $220, but that’s another story). And I wanted to help her. Because I loved her. 

She got $800k in late 2018. It was around the time I decided I wasn’t going to ever waste another moment on not buying all the bitcoin I could. You see bitcoin was back down to the $6k-7k range, and so I was adding as much as I could—even had my mom adding. And that’s about the time I started to tell my girlfriend about Bitcoin for the first time. 

Well, my girlfriend at first hears me out, listens, it makes sense to her. She even buys a bitcoin. A whole bitcoin, and 5 ETH, and even a few litecoin I think. Which is more than I even had at the time and I had just embarked on my “I’m never selling again” Bitcoin path.  Cool. Let’s put it together. Awesome. Here’s our 1.9btc. I’ll keep adding. She takes the other 95% of that $800k and puts it in stocks. I’m like, “perfect”. 

We endure the crash to $3-4K, though some of her stocks were crashing too, and I’m still adding. She doesn’t say much during this time, but I can see she’s evaluating me and my “Bitcorn investment I got her into”. We joke about it. I promise her that eventually the price HAS to go up. To simply wait. 

Over the next few months we have lots a few talks about finances, buying a home, etc. It gets really stressful at times because she feels like I have no clue what I’m talking about, because I’m A.) Five years younger than her, and B.) have never dealt with more than 50,000k worth of money. And I, the guy who trades derivative and does my entire families taxes, think she doesn’t know anything about finances except how to spend money. This seems to sadly be becoming the one factor that’s going to tear us apart. And we were both painful stubborn when the topic came up. 

Then bitcoin goes to 13.8k! Bam! This was during the Bitcoin2019 convention. I actually stayed on the couch with her daughter and her boyfriend in the city so that I could attend. I’m telling her all my little cute stories. Oh I met so and so. Oh I was having drinking beer with that Peter guy I’m always telling you about. Haha, listen to the new story about Craig Wright’s stupid ass. 

And then bitcoin starts to crash again. 

It’s around then ($10k) that she tells me she wants to sell. I tell her she can sell, sure, but I promise she is going to regret it. “Look, bitcoin is very likely going to go to 100k, and then 1 million dollars someday.” 

She just rolls her eyes at me. 

BUT STILL, SHE DOESN’T SELL. 

Later she says she wants to sell it so she can buy a truck for me so I can do my work (I’m an independent contractor). I tell her I absolutely appreciate the offer, but I would prefer her hold the bitcoin to me having the truck, as I had access to a truck anyway. 

I’m trying to figure out how to reasonably talk her into investing **more** in Bitcoin, but I don’t say anything. She has her 1btc now, she can watch price action, and she will keep adding if it start to show to be a worthy investment. 

It hurts when you see something that others don’t. I mean it really fucks sucks. To be called deluded. To be ridiculed. But I took it all in stride. I just told her if she ever **really** wants to sell, that I would help her do so. 

Then she suddenly decides she has to move. Across the country. Because she is “too poor” now to live in Sonoma County anymore (her reasoning). 

I try to tell her that’s ridiculous, that me and her family are here. But she won’t have it. She is adamant. She wants to move south. And she begins to scope out places. For several months, we travel to the south. We consider seven different states as possible candidates. 

Then she up up and just goes to Arizona, alone, and loves it. Invites me down to visit and consider moving there with her. I look at places there too. I’m not a fan of the heat, and I told her Arizona was at the bottom of my list, but I love her. 

It’s just her anxiety gets to be unbearable of the next three weeks. She can’t handle the thought of moving there alone, and losing everything. She feels like her world is crashing in. No money. She feels like she is being forced  to move to Arizona to buy a small home, and get a shit job, because she’s back to being poor again—and now she thinks I’m bailing on her, and that I don’t love her because I’m apprehensive about uprooting my life and moving to the fucking desert. But I feel like she’s bailing on me!

So she comes back to the city one last time to get her stuff. I’m starting to try to figure out when and how I’m going to follow her, and move to Arizona. I’m absolutely in love with this woman. But I also let her know that I thinking moving to Arizona isn’t a pragmatic decision. That she should stay here. 

But I think by that point she had already vacated the relationship. For real. It was like she just slid out the door into another world. She gave me her ledger and all her crypto and told me goodbye. It’s like she though I wanted the crypto more than her. I told her I would hang onto it for her. 

In her mind, she felt like I used her for her money, turned into this crazy Bitcoin cult follower, and left her to rot in Arizona. 

I kept trying to tell her we could have enough to sail off into the sun together forever if she would just trust me. But I know, I KNOW, I had to sound fucking crazy to her: “Oh, just take that money you got from enduring a shitty abusive relationship and throw it in my magic internet money scam!”

It sucked. Bad. Losing her was unbelievably traumatic. But I can’t just not do what seems like the most obvious thing I need to do—which is stay employed and keep pouring my money into bitcoin while it’s cheap. 

But I also understand why she left! I know I must have seemed nuts during the second half of 2019 when bitcoin was falling off steadily, and I was throwing every paycheck I had into it. 

*TL;DR: I know it looks like we are crazy to you other earthlings out there! But it’s just so obvious to us!*

*BTC GOOD. FIAT BAD.*

*Anyway, if you are out there still Jess. I still love you. Still wish you would put your money in bitcoin so you could finally stop worrying about money and move your ass back to California with me and away from that hot Covid invested shithole.*

Happy New Year!

**REAL TL;DR: My girlfriend left me because she thought I was crazy and in some bitcoin cult and unable to be financially responsible. Had she trusted me we could be retiring right now. C’est la vie.**","","COMEDY","/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kom9we/my_girlfriend_left_me_a_year_ago_because_she/","My girlfriend left me a year ago because she though I was in a Bitcoin cult—and therefore completely financially irresponsible.

"","","What are Index Pools?

Index pools are tokenized asset pools that wrap the top tokens in a market sector into a single asset. Each pool is an index that periodically updates its weights and tokens to better represent a market sector, such as defi or crypto generally, and is a high-fee AMM capable of generating revenue beyond the growth of the underlying assets.

Index tokens allow you to hold a single token which represents the top tokens in a market sector, and to easily manage your exposure to a market without needing to constantly manage your portfolio or research each tracked asset. Their prices also serve as benchmarks of general market performance that can be used to assess other investments.


What's DEFI5?

DEFI5 is a tokenized, passively managed index that tracks the top 5 DeFi tokens by market cap. The index autonomously updates its weights and tokens held using preset rules and on-chain market data. The value of the index is entirely determined by the value of the underlying assets, which are held by the portfolio in amounts proportional to their weights. There are no management fees, and DEFI5 tokens can be minted, burned or traded on demand to easily manage your exposure to the DeFi market.


How do you select tokens?

Tokens are selected automatically and weighted by market cap for the index from a DAO voted whitelist that meet the requirements for the category DEFI5 

- The token is at least a week old.
- No major vulnerabilities have been discovered in the token contract.
- The token's supply can not be arbitrarily inflated or deflated maliciously and there are no transfer fees or other non-standard balance updates.
- The token meets the requirements of the ERC20 standard.
- The token has a fully diluted market cap of at least $50 million.
- At least $1 million worth of liquidity is locked in the Uniswap market pair between the token and WETH.
-The token is a protocol or governance token for a DeFi project.


Rebalances and Reweighs

The weights are updated every 7d and every 4 reweighs a Rebalance can be triggered to update the underlying tokens for the index from the categories above.
The actual token weights and balances gradually move toward the targets set by the reweighs and reindexes to minimize loss of funds from arbitrage.


Minting and Burning

New index tokens can be minted by providing all the underlying tokens according to their weights. We created a uniswap auto minter which automatically purchases all the needed tokens and mints through uniswap. Index tokens can be burned to retrieve the underlying assets in proportion to the number of tokens burned, are fully collateralized at all times, and their value is based only on the value of the underlying assets.

"","","I'm not a programmer, but I have a big idea. What if we created a coin called, ""Cryptomedia"" that funds an ad-free, completely transparent social media company. Something like 0.5% transaction fee when buying or selling coins.

I think even there could be 2 versions; an under 18 version with strict guidelines on sexuality, drug use, bullying, and other inappropriate behavior, and an over 18 version with full nudity allowed, focused on privacy and freedom of expression.

The design for the media would be as clean and minimal as possible, crowdsourcing certain projects like designing filters or even supporting new media file types. The company could be an example of how to handle a utility in the modern world, giving complete transparency into the finances, constantly updating the community on how things are progressing (on the official Cryptomedia page so you can choose to not look at it). The staff involved could be paid a comfortable wage, but no $350 million dollar CEO. In fact, there could be a rule that the highest-paid member can't exceed double the wage of the lowest-paid member.

If successfully implemented, there could be a huge amount of money leftover, and that could be given back to the people who have held the coin based on staking, and maybe could have some community votes on other alternatives like charity, or building renewable energy resources.

I'm fed up with our lives being controlled by the shady corrupt, shoving ads down our throats every 2 seconds. Our world needs change and the technology is right in front of our faces. 

Anyways what do y'all think?

"","","I have seen many many posts over the last few weeks of new investors asking if now is a good time to buy some Bitcoin or any crypto in general. This is always followed by some comments of people saying yes or no or whatever predictions they have. In a nutshell:

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody knows what is going to happen. The price could keep going up for a long time, or a correction could be imminent. As someone who has been in crypto for a few years, this bull run feels very different. We are seeing institutional investors buying like crazy, something that I personally think will continue throughout 2021 also. Nevertheless, when there is a dip, nobody will know.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead of asking when it will dip or whether you should buy, ask yourself if you are investing for the log term. If your answer is yes, and you truly feel like we are entering a massive bull run, then buy your crypto and just wait. The same people who bought at 10k who questioned whether they were being foolish are now making a killing, but they too took the risk of not knowing what will happen to the price. 

This is a highly speculative market, it carries a lot of risk with it. So if you are questioning whether to invest now and are terrified of investing and the price dipping, this market is not for you. We could rally for weeks and then correct, or vice versa. So just make a decision and then STICK WITH IT. Don't get emotional, and most importantly, don't take financial advice from anyone on the internet ...

"","","When I was in high school back in +/- 2012, a friend introduced me to crypto during one of our finance classes. We had to put together a paper portfolio and give a report at the end of the semester. 

Anyways I thought it was a neat concept and bought maybe $50-$100 with my part time money (big ballin', I know) and stored them on a digital wallet. Knowing me I did no research nor did I record any info about where I stored it. I need some help finding wallet platforms that were popular around that time and I could probably figure out the rest from there if any luck.","","FOCUSED-DISCUSSION","/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kpeolr/can_any_of_you_help_me_find_my_btc/","Can any of you help me find my BTC?","{}","","self","","self.CryptoCurrency","False","1609652214","","{}","CryptoCurrency","8","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kpeolr/can_any_of_you_help_me_find_my_btc/","t5_2wlj3","","True","","theradicaltiger","t3_kpeolr","FOCUSED-DISCUSSION","0","False","kpeolr","17","","","False"

I heard about the delisting of the SALT token, but from what I have read, the loans are managed by a smart contract, and the website seems perfectly functioning. Is this a safe lending site (on par with Nexo, Blockfi, etc.)?","","FINANCE","/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kpdq61/is_salt_lending_legit/","Is Salt Lending legit?","{}","","self","","self.CryptoCurrency","False","1609648453","","{}","CryptoCurrency","4","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kpdq61/is_salt_lending_legit/","t5_2wlj3","","True","","nightfire0","t3_kpdq61","FINANCE","0","False","kpdq61","13","","","False"

"","","I love cryptos and bitcoin but this sub is a crazy echo chamber where critical discussion is constantly downvoted.

So I'll list a few points of concern and feel free to tear them apart in comments.

Also, if you have any other reasons why bitcoin, cryptos or people will fail/lose their money feel free to list them in comments for others to respond to.

1. Tether printer goes brrrr - tether doesn't allow transparent audits of their books and is printing billions of dollars. If this money isn't really backed by usd then it has resulted in the btc being inflated heavily and as soon as people try and withdraw, the whole market will collapse.

2. XRP is being sued - it shows the the us gov does not care how long a project has been around or how big it is (xrp was #3 for a long time). How many other smaller projects are going to start being taken to court?

3. Bitcoin is becoming increasingly centralised - what was once meant to be power to the people is becoming more and more centralised by the day. Big players don't fall to scams and don't have weak hands. They'll just keep buying the dip and the wealth will go back to the 1% eventually.

3b. With so much control by such few players and little regulations, whales can crash the market whenever they want and squeeze many people out.

4. Bitcoin can't be used seriously whilst it's price is so unstable. It also can no longer take us to the moon if it price finally stabilises. 

5. Bitcoin is too difficult to use - I'm still scared everytime I make a transaction, worried that I messed up and its gone forever. We've seen the countless posts of people being scammed or mistakenly their entire amount being used as gas fees etc.

So either a 3rd party has to manage your coins, which defeats the entire purpose or the majority of people are simply unable to use cryptos.","","EDUCATIONAL","/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kpcov5/prove_me_wrong_bitcoin_is_a_bubble_and_you_will/","Prove me wrong: Bitcoin is a bubble and you will end up broke for investing (read the post before downvoting)","{}","","self","","self.CryptoCurrency","False","1609644743","Platinum | QC: CC 226","{}","CryptoCurrency","27","False","False","False","","https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kpcov5/prove_me_wrong_bitcoin_is_a_bubble_and_you_will/","t5_2wlj3","","True","","PM_ME_PLASTIC_BAGS","t3_kpcov5","mod1","0","False","kpcov5","72","","","False"

"","","I want to get a bit more into crypto but one of the main barriers is just the complexity.  I've played with Ethereum a little but it's a bit tedious remembering all the commands and what not like for making a wallet or making a transaction etc.    Is there a web front end I can install on a local Linux server where it manages everything for all the major cryptos, where I can essentially create wallets, make transactions etc all from a web front end?  Basically, like an exchange, but local. 

I presume I would need to sync the block chain for each crypto I want to use, and I'm ok with that.    I'm mostly interested in Bitcoin and Ethereum. When I used Ethereum I was using myetherwallet but I want something more local as I feel it would be more secure.   I also don't want to rely on any specific application that has to be installed on a desktop, I want something that runs on Linux server as a web front end.   Easier to backup, manage etc.

"","","I'm not saying bitcoin's valuation isn't justified, so please don't downvote me into oblivion. I'm just trying to understand why it's so valuable. The USD-BTC exchange rate is something astronomically small, much smaller than any exchange rate between two fiat currencies (as far as I know). In fact, the only scenario I can think of in which exchange rates similar to that of USD-BTC would exist between fiat currencies would be in cases of hyperinflation (or hyperdeflation, I guess). Can anybody explain what's going on here?

"","","Prior to the GrayScale/PayPal/MicroStrategy mega-BTC buying spree, LTC scaled with some predictability as compared to BTC. Today, however, it's far behind its normal correlation. This is true despite the fact that PayPal included Litecoin in it's shortlist of 4 cryptocurrencies that are tradeable on their platform (also ETH and BCH). Other than PayPal, however, I don't believe LTC is being added into any mainstream/crossover ETFs or Hedge Funds, and I suppose this is to blame?

i just had quite a stressful experience transferring some funds from a paper wallet to an exchange

i‚Äôve written the story below share my experience to help any others in the same situation and perhaps improve the user experience

i used the android mycelium wallet as it has been around for years and had good reputation years ago 

i was using blockchaininfo but it seems the paper wallet functionality has been completely broken by updates

after scanning an encrypted paper wallet  i chose to send  of the  to an exchange

i quickly received the funds but notice that the transaction showed

 from paperwallet transferred to  exchange and  to  a new address starting with 

 

this is when i started to panic and suspected mycelium had become illegitimate

there is a lot of adds and banners bloating the app

i was convinced it had skimmed some of my transaction into another address

after several frustrating attempts at importing the encrypted key in another wallet to get the remaining  i finally got them out of the potentially compromised paper wallet using an old version of httpsbitaddressorg and electrum in windows

this whole time i was rushing and disregarding some normal security protocols in an attempt the get the funds off before any malicious actor might







after a stressful hour i discovered that when importing a  private key mycelium lists  addresses that the key corresponds to

when i did a partial spend the  was sent to this other address ‚Ä¶

i was able to rescan the paper wallet with mycelium and spend the  from ‚Ä¶

all in all it was a very stressful experience and i did a number of risky things in my panic  
 i considered myself fairly knowledgeable in bitcoin and yet this still happened 

hopefully this experience is helpful to others take what you want from it",story long term holder was convinced i just had  btc stolen by mycelium,2021-01-01

"since there are many people sharing their bitcoin stories i want to share mine

i learned about bitcoin from a coworker soon after starting a position at nasa goddard in early  where worked to manage weather satellite algorithms he had been using some old gpus to mine in his basement and showed me the genesis block hash functions and live blockchain transactions as they came over the network it was clearly a sideproject for him but i began taking my own interest in it when i came home from work

it was my first job after grad school and i had just finished setting up my  benefits when i decided to buy a little bitcoin as well i figured that if public markets were theoretically the most intelligently priced bitcoin must have a lot of potential because it was the freest market imaginable this came at a time of living in the dc area and an exposure to national politics and spending time writing a personal novel downtown after work when i didn‚Äôt have many connections i learned about quantitative easing fiscal policy and the move off the gold standard it further solidified my bitcoin obsession and i wound up on poloniex from the june  altcoin season of course i was a newbie and lost just as much as i gained in the end i realized all i cared about was increasing my btc and eos position at the time back then it was and still is only a moderate amount

after that i held until the end of the year when i sold a bunch of btc and paid off my car but all along i knew it was a short term top so my obsession continued i ended up leaving my job at nasa to find a blockchain group where i could use my software engineering skills i did indeed find a healthcare startup but didn‚Äôt have the web experience to contribute much to the team

last year my primarily financial obsession with bitcoin changed when i slowly formulated an idea i was and still am obsessed with blockchain eosio in particular and i found some place to feel at peace with the price swings and missed opportunities margin trading    applying my knowledge and understanding of climate i started a company to launch weather balloons in west africa to collect weather data and reward students with digital currency i learned about microcontrollers iot web development and  printing and made my prototype ideas a reality i feel compelled to do this because i believe there are only a handful of people that have the technical background in weather software and climate to found a company like this

two months ago a press release by coindesk was shared on nasdaq‚Äôs website



even though my btc stacks are only moderate i don‚Äôt feel as though i‚Äôm missing an opportunity by not leveraging long on an exchange because i see my project as a call option on crypto in general

maybe there‚Äôs someone else out there that feels guilty about not leveraging their own btc to make even more profit if that‚Äôs case i encourage them to get creative and use their own background to improve or change society in one way or another after all we all come from different places and can bring something new to the table",my story from nasa to bitcoin,2021-01-01

"short version

decentralized group of oracles publish pgp public keys followed after a delay by the corresponding private keys bitcoiners can get some physical security by time locking keys needed to spend utxos by encrypting the spend keys to a pgp public key published by the oracle in order to spend the funds they must wait for the private key to be published if a robber asks them to send funds it is not possible to do so without waiting for the timeout or by some other method that is not attractive for the robber this is sort of like cltv but you can ‚Äúrenew‚Äù the timeout without making an on chain transaction



long version

as the price of bitcoin goes up bitcoin holders may worry about their physical security the best case scenario is when no one knows about the wealth you control but this may not be achievable for everyone due to exchange data spills kyc record keeping tax reporting requirements or other information leaks

what can you do to protect yourself from the dreaded five dollar wrench attack or hostage ransom attack a dog and a shotgun are nice to have but it is fundamentally very difficult to defend yourself from a physical attack from a smart patient adversary

it‚Äôs worth noticing that there have been publicly identifiable rich people for a long time yet robberies and hostage attacks remain infrequent unfortunately bitcoin has properties that give reason to suspect that physical attacks could be more likely

 you do not need to involve or inform any other people to transfer bitcoin to an attacker‚Äôs address bitcoin transfers are private

 you can transfer a fortune in bitcoin within a few minutes bitcoin transfers are fast

 bitcoin transfers are irreversible

these properties are great to have when you need them but having all three could be a big liability if it attracts robbers

in order to thwart attackers it would be a good idea to set it up so that you cannot have all three at the same time for example you could lock your coins with a script that allows the coins to be spent either with the help of a third party or no sooner than one year in the future that way you cannot pay a robber without involving the third party and if the third party fails you get your coins back at the end of the year

as a more flexible variation on the above idea suppose that there were some oracle ‚Äî perhaps a tor hidden service ‚Äî that simply published a pgp public key every day and then  days later it published the corresponding private key perhaps it would sell the private key for a fee over the lightning network now your coins could be locked with a script that opens two ways

 you can spend the coins immediately

 you can spend the coins at the end of one year

then you encrypt the spend key for option  to the pgp key of the oracle and delete your unencrypted copies of the spend key now the coins are locked for  days until the oracle publishes the pgp private key once the pgp private key is published you could decrypt your spend private key and if you like you could encrypt it again to a new pgp public key published by the oracle to again lock the coins for  days



automatic lock renewal

as a method to automatically renew the lock what you could do is the following

 oracle has a list of  secrets it switches to the next secret every day after the final secret it switches back to the first secret
 you send a secret to the oracle and ask to make a public key
 the oracle combines your secret with the oracles secret for that day oracle uses a secure hash to combine the oracle secret and your secret lets say the secret is an ecies private key
 the oracle sends you back the corresponding public key
 you encrypt your file to the public key and delete the original
 now you have to wait until  days pass and the oracle returns to the correct secret so that you are able to obtain your key if you do not obtain the secret the window closes at the end of the day for  more days
 attacker cannot get your private key from the oracle before robbing you because they do not have your secret

keys in the oracle carousel could expire after some number of rotations eg expire after  rotations and become accessible every day for some grace period like  year so that people can use them to decrypt their files and move them to a different carousel key



additional thoughts

 oracles could publish a pgp public key each day and make the corresponding private key accessible one year later if you wanted to lock your coins for a shorter time just pick an older pgp public key for example pick one published  days ago so that you can get the private key in  days

 for redundancy you could encrypt your private key with pgp keys from several different oracles

 wallets could handle all of this timelocking behind the scenes and simply present the user with a ‚Äúlock coins for x days‚Äù interface

 locking can occur on a perutxo basis so you could stagger your utxos on the calendar eg you could give yourself access to a different chunk of bitcoin each month for  months

 if you find that you need to sell a bunch of bitcoin but yours are all locked up you can always use loans and futures contracts

 an alternative to cltv for a backup spend method could be something like an m of n shamir scheme with shards at several bank deposit boxes lawyer etc

 oracle‚Äôs could get paid for private keys with lightning and use lightning capacity as an anti sybil proof

 this idea is very private and decentralized for example the oracle has no insight into who uses the service or how much money is being protected",key calendar for physical security,2021-01-01

bitcoin price

i love bitcoin and i want other people to love it too although i never forcefeed anything even when im asked to talk a little about bitcoin however one of the excuses i most often hear for why someone cant buy bitcoin right now is because its too expensive

sure the price of one bitcoin as of this writing is about  each however that is only because of what we as people define one bitcoin to mean satoshi whoever he is arbitrarily decided that  million satoshis   bitcoin so when we look at bitcoins as shares similar to how public companies have shares outstanding there are  million of them maxdivided into the market value you get the share price of  for one share

however that definition was arbitrary perhaps satoshi could have just as easily decreed that  thousand satoshis   bitcoin so that what we all know today as  mbtc would be  bitcoin as such thered be  billion shares of bitcoin instead of  million all of us today would still be praising the finite limit of only  billion bitcoins the difference is that today one bitcoin would be  instead of  would we all be collectively creaming our pants watching the bitcoin price go from  to  to  etc like we all currently do at every  price increase milestone i dont know but a stock price going from  to  to  etc definitely isnt as exciting as  to  and a stock price going from  to   to  or higher isnt unheard of either apple has about  billion shares outstanding on its own

anyways all this is to say yes what we see as the bitcoin price right now doesnt matter or at least isnt what most people think it is most people dont understand that the price is what it is because of how we arbitrarily defined bitcoin within the protocols number of total tokens a different definiton would make bitcoin the same thing but have a lower much more reasonable price of maybe  today meaning more people would feel more comfortable buying at these prices

what does this mean im not sure is it a mental barrier that will be overcome throughout the populous over time is bitcoin an iq test and people who believe it too expensive based on sticker price simply fail one thing im pretty sure of however is that those who do realize and understand this can better understand why bitcoin is still cheapand not pie in the sky expensive like many people still seem to believe and therefore do not act on acquiring any

tldr dont consider the bitcoin price only its market value



owning bitcoin

there seems to be a trend of corporations holding a part of their treasury holdings as bitcoin meaningfully kicked off by microstrategy i dont see any reason why this trend wont continue i can imagine a nottoodistant future in which it could be commonplace for companies to hold  of their cash in bitcoin

if this is the case does this mean the average person can get enough bitcoin exposure simply by holding a fund of for example sampp  companies if most companies hold bitcoin and im holding spy do i get enough bitcoin exposure through that such that i dont need to hold bitcoins on my own in order to protect my portfolio from inflation etc id just get exposure indirectly through owning shares of companies that hold it

yes i understand not your keys not your bitcoin and all that im just talking about the normies not the diehard hardwarewallet holding key splitting fuck the man type of bitcoin holders  who are cool too for the average person assuming moremost companies do hold bitcoin does one get enough exposure to bitcoin by simply holding a diversified stock fund

and if so would there even be advantages for example if each company is holding their own bitcoins and presumably either managing their own keys or using different custodians etc does that diversify away some risk of securing your bitcoins owning a ledger for all your bitcoins is cool but if you lose your seed phrase youre kind of fucked just a thought

this is why i think that i wouldnt mind one day when the time is right to exchange some of my aftertax hodlings to keep in equities time is right meaning that companies are actually doing this would it be enough for normies would love to hear others thoughts",a couple of bitcoin bathtub thoughts,2021-01-02

"two part question i use copay on my mac to store my bitcoin and ive read some negative things about this due to its relationship with bitpay in fact the copay wallet seems to have httpsgithubcombitpaycopay do you agree that copay is unsafe to use as a desktop wallet ive enjoyed copay clean ui and its features are sufficient for me but if theres some underlying risk to using it then id rather just move away from it

if so id probably switch to electrum as that is what i see recommended if i do this when setting up electrum is it better to restore my same wallet using my seed again any risk with this due to the seed being used in the copay wallet or just create a brand new wallet and send the btc to myself the second option seems overall easier but maybe unnecessary

my question is is it common for people to take profits say monthly while never withdrawing more than your original investment if you‚Äôre up just say  at the end of the year what would the difference be if you wait the year to take profits than taking profits every few weeks or something because if it crashes overnight at least you have the profit you‚Äôve already taken but if it keeps steady the whole year you‚Äôre still in the same position as before

"im loving the price rises the start of a new bull run the inflows from institutions the favorable press from people who mattertm etc as much as anyone and im holding forever because i buy into the longterm proposition that btc is a generational store of value like most capital assets but

 do we really know what the institutions plans are medium to longterm i agree with the consensus that theyre getting in at least partly to shield themselves from the beating that fiat is about to take from central banks but what happens ifwhen central banks once again get a hold on inflation what happens when interest rates pick back up institutions move in and out of gold under the same circumstances for that matter what if were all wrong and the institutions are in this for the bull run what if theyre all planning to profittake at  i understand that any specific scenario on its own is unlikely but my point is that their intentions arent fully knowable they can read charts much better than most of us they know when the last halving was maybe whales dont manipulate the price anymore but im far from convinced that institutional investments constitute legitimacy on the same scale as precious metals yet
 which brings me to point  how much of btcs rise against fiat lately is pricing in the expectation of future fiat inflation everyone who genuinely thinks theyre buying a lambo when btc hits  might be in for some serious disappointment when they discover that fiat inflation means that lambos start at  by the time lamborghini starts accepting payment in btc im exaggerating of course but on the other hand btc has risen about   to  in the last  months as compared with usd if you compare it with xau its only   to  those are substantially different and enough to make me concerned about the true value of the apparent price rise speculating is completely pointless at this stage but i find it interesting to wonder what the ultimate fair price of goods in satsbtc will be and how sellers will behave

footnote to point  an additional thing to worry about there is why people will ever spend btc unless we get to the imo extremely unlikely scenario of  global adoption as the sole means of exchange the incentives will always be in favour of savinginvesting btc no maxis defi is not going away yes people must be able to invest btc and get a return otherwise it forms a shitty economic system which people will abandon because it fails to allow for the creation of wealth and spending whatever alternative is less deflationaryprovides less return basically the only way people will be incentivised to spend btc is if their creditors only accept btc for payment of debts and obligations otherwise youre using an inherently deflationary asset to pay inflationary obligations

"im hearing a lot of chatter about how the next run up will be different as we now have major institutional involvement and their diamond hands wont be selling etc well i think this will likely be true to some degree but i think that what people arent considering enough is that there will also be heavy hitting trade desks and prop firms that are going to be getting a lot more active in crypto and you can sure as hell bet those guys are going to be selling when things get as technically overextended as they are now honestly i think you could make a good argument that they might even cause increased volatility as they will be aggressively playing both sides potentially driving price faster and harder as a result of more shortmargin activity

i think right now is a perfect example of how that could play out were at  and clearly pretty extended on almost all timeframes ifwhen the momentum starts to turn there will likely be some bit short positions taken say they ride those positions down  and then decide that they are happy and want to cover their position  in order to do so they will obviously have to start buying would could then trigger price to turn right around

obviously these are just the basic mechanics of the market that have always been in play although i think we should consider the possibility that there will be some players with no intention of just holding and are just here to ride the waves",low volatility moving forward i dont buy it,2021-01-03

"i understand the people who believe that we should just invest an amount that we can afford to lose in bitcoin for me that is applicable for speculative playsassets with more than a decade under its belt i do not think bitcoin is pure speculative anymore some of its supposed uses are currently being tested

what i am trying to say is that it is not really the price that you should just be looking into it is also about its uses if somehow the government or anything will disrupt its use that is the time to sell without disruption you can just buy the dip or keep on putting money 

with the arrival of the big institutions i think the smart money is now accepting some or maybe the majority of its supposed role in finance i do believe that this is the reason why bitcoin bounceback last march together with all the other assets 

and also the possible reason why we have not seen a  correction at its run above  

and personally my favorite use of bitcoin is that it is antiinflation and for super rich people and entities this is actually important to them normally super rich guysentities hate losing money and they understand that dormant money is losing value due to inflation

do you think those institutions primarily entered their money in bitcoin because they want to speculate it reaching  i do not think that is the case most of them will be happy of gaining  annually just to avoid the effect of inflation  


if my thought process is true bitcoin will just keep on getting higher so instead of looking at the price i think it is much better actually that you look for ways to get more cash to enter into bitcoin while taking notes of the risk that could disrupt its use",bitcoin is not a speculative play anymore,2021-01-03

"cs major here im really struggling to understand some of bitcoin basic terminology  even after using it for years

i have some very dumb questions that i cant seem to find easy answers to

 why do public keys exist in the first place

 moving edit here since it changes the question dramatically

edit

i think i should flip the question and instead of asking whats the purpose of public keys i should ask whats the purpose of addresses why not just using public keys for receiving money



edit changed the post to better reflect my question 

just to clarify im not asking

 or how to get a public key from a private key

  how to get a bitcoin address from a public key

im asking why do public keys addresses exist in the first place whats their purpose as i understand we can use private keys to spend  addresses public keys to receive what is then the purpose of an address

are public keys just an implementation detail that allows us to calculate multiple addresses for a specific private key or is there something else to it



public keys addresses get mentioned everywhere even in bitcoin introductions for beginners so my guess is they must do something else that im missing an introduction to bitcoin for beginners wouldnt bring up elliptic curve cryptography another technical implementation detail so do addresses have any other purpose other than receiving money sisnce you can do that with public key 

additional quesitons

a private key has  or multiple public keys

can i pay to a public key or does it always has to be an address

"bitcoin was created to give financial sovereignty  rightfully ours  to the individual by stealing it back from the nationstate that foulest of usurpers bitcoin is a tool but is also a tremendously powerful weapon unlike all prior attempts to accomplish this feat throughout history bitcoin does not rely on violence but instead works insidiously by turning capitalism against itself

knowing this the rational capitalist should avoid bitcoin at all costs of course capitalism isnt rational or sane nor are most capitalists aware of what i just explained to you nor can any of them resist the new economic reality that bitcoin inevitably creates

capitalism is like anaerobic bacteria and transparency is oxygen bitcoin forces capitalism into an environment the publicly auditable blockchain which is hyperoxygenated with transparency and therefore toxic and ultimately fatal to capitalism once a sufficient fraction of earths wealth has been absorbed onto the blockchain humanity will be forced to stare this structural genocide in the face and at some point compassion and ethics will take hold once again that will be the point at which capitalism breaks down completely and then we transcend away from our current dystopia

very few people are going to adopt bitcoin for altruistic reasons or to support some idealistic vision of bringing about a less violent world the vast majority of earths population will be dragged along many of them kicking in screaming hyperbitcoinization will create a situation of irresistible economic coercion simply put it will be a stampede everyone eventually including governments will divest from national fiat and invest in bitcoin because every other currency is going to be relatively worthless in the not too distant future

bitcoin uses the logic of capitalism insidiously against itself just as capitalism insidiously twists both culture ritual and pseudoscience economics to serve the interests of the elite in other words you have no choice but to capitulate you only get to decide how much wealth you bleed out before capitulation

but isnt human nature the reason capitalism sucks in short no capitalism is a system of distributing goods and resources built largely on  century economic mythology  pseudoscience with a bunch of ritual layered on top there were no special flaws in human nature that spawned capitalism in the first place its just a system that was engineered over three hundred years ago it was created by people who thought slavery was ethically aokay

they did the best they could in fact the transition from feudalism to capitalism was at the time a major net good  the beginning of a more compassionate and far less wasteful system for distributing goods and resources they just werent anywhere near as good at systemsengineering or ethics as we modern folk are today no one has ever successfully dismantled this system and tried to build a better more compassionate one

its a proud tradition of organized capitalists to crush any viable alternatives before they have a chance to take root unfortunately for the capitalist masters of the universe violence is completely ineffective as a leveraging tool on the blockchain for the first time in history a peaceful revolution is possible essentially for the first time in history we can just walk away

for the past three hundred years all weve done is add layer after layer of complexity to an ancient and antiquated system until you get what we have today a hideously overengineered system collapsing under its own weight bitcoin is a wrench in the gears of a very old very complex and very fragile machine  capitalism is now a dead thing walking",the financial singularity theory how bitcoin swallows the world and ultimately breaks capitalism,2021-01-03

"im new around here but this goes for any appreciating asset if you are in the us dont sell your btc to pay off a mortgage or even pay outright for property heres why 

interest rates are historically low  your mortgage debt is likely to be an asset once rates start going back up for every  in mortgage debt every additional  point is another  in total paid so if you have a  mortgage at  and interest rates go up to  the total cost for life of the  loan will be  less there is a good chance this differential can become an asset in itself 
 
and just as important  you never own property outright you have to pay property taxes and with the debt the government is piling up right now dont be surprised to see those rates increase the less capital you have sunk into the asset the greater flexibility you will have should there be significant overreach or other issues civil unrest etc in the meantime your btc is completely portable 

at this point the only thing i would consider cashing in for is

 temporary mortgage payments if you lost a job 
 to make a downpayment on a property  the minimum possible and if with that you cant afford the mortgage payment then you cant afford to buy you must figure out a way to get cashflow otherwise there is a high likelihood you will fuck up and wind up losing your investment 
 partial payment on a cashflowing investment  but only if i already had experience in the field with similar successful cashflowing investments

so if i understood correctly multiple people or coorperates or whoever that own a large chunk of btc so called whales sell at price x make the price drop for a short time and then buy again at low price to profit is this kinda correct and is it only for profit or is there a larger picture why do whales do this because it makes to sense to me only profit wise i read something about leveraged longs and shorts but im too new for this need more research but thought maybe people here could help out

now i was also wondering is there a way of knowing when these so called whales do this i was lucky to sell just  efore the fall and bought back a little higher then the lowest point but this was luck and because i had my own scheme for what could work for me but with this strategy i will lose in the long run i think could you anticipate to this

"right now its extremely difficult to do that since new bitcoins are mined every day but think in the long run


the only way for bitcoin to work is for us to be able to spend it and earn it 


what if all businesses work with the same model as in they can receive payment and sell their products and services for bitcoin but will not pay their employees with it 


even the hodlers eventually when the price no longer rises and stabilises at a certain point either have to spend it or convert it to fiat and with diminishing ways to earn it or buy it bitcoin will slowly disappear from the general public even the miners might get the option to pay their electricity fees at a discount in bitcoin to stop it from getting sold or maybe even take over the majority hash rate not to attack the network but merely to monopolize the transaction fees then the bitcoin flow will be cut even more


will the governments order employers to pay their workers in bitcoin and not their national fiat currency that they have complete control of


but the government is for the people so they have to listen right right not really but even if they did guess what happens next


paypal yup crypto banks that holds bitcoin for you but theyre not yours but dont worry trust us and your money is safe you can buy hold and sell and even get paid in crypto yay but you cant get it out from our system cuz national security and terrorists and so on look what happens at  a repeat of  but bitcoin funded them


crypto banks now control the price of bitcoin but again inflation and like slowly boiling a frog the general public wont notice and wont care and the very purpose of bitcoin is gone like that of course we will be able to benefit from it and use it as intended for the next coming decades but you never know what the future holds this is only one the many scenarios that might happen maybe governments arent really that evil 


now for the people who are wondering how i came to this probable scenario its the simple curiosity for the term bitcoin marxist so i went and looked up marxism until i fell into  youtube videos from  but the thing that clicked for me the most was not marxism but capitalisms ability to adapt youll have to watch all  videos first to truly get what im trying to say but listening from  and in  because it wasnt easy to do the usual capitalist safety measures thats where they removed the gold standard and went on inflation in earnest 


again just a scenario and maybe i dont know what im talking about",i think i just found a big bitcoin problem what if the rich and powerful decide to use bitcoin as their store of value i mean exclusively their store of value,2021-01-03

"inspired by the recent my bitcoin stories and andreas antonopolous lectures forgive any poor punctuation spelling errors or inconsistencies im stuck inside with snow and a howling dog just a little love story to the hodlers

he always had the last laugh jody would say that was matts first thought when he saw the nurse rushing up behind him in the reflection of the hospital doors he knew what she had to say before theyd opened her voice saying mr ryan and the cold and noise of the winter rain hitting his face at the same moment it was just like dad to wait to catch him by surprise it was just like dad to be stubborn later he would think maybe hed subconsciously heard the pa announce a code blue but in their heart of hearts he knew dad just had show him up one last time leaving a dying man was a bet that he would live until morning dad loved to win bets

jody showed up first then melanie matts wife they were supposed to be discussing his funerary arrangements his personal possessions in the room and so on matt just looked in his lap melanie was quiet and warmly supportive as usual jody was the first to speak

i wish hed let us take him home she said

he didnt want to burden us

but to die in a place like this he could have done better he could have saved something or we could have taken care of him 

ill call the funeral home in the morning matt cut her off theyd been through it before and hed liked to have let jody have a good cry they could both have used it but if she started shed never stop

an orderly interrupted the conversation with a quiet mr taylor he had a form to sign remission of personal belongings a manilla envelope and a small canvas bag matt signed and looked in the bag clothes in case dad had walked out fat chance who ever does he couldnt stop looking jody took the envelope and opened it she retrieved a locket their moms at one time she squeezed the little latch the gold heart opening to reveal a picture of her on one side and matt on the other they squeezed each others hands lips pursed nodded



matt looked out the window melanie driving their workhorse subaru they couldnt agree on whether to upgrade save or pay down debt and it still ran so the driver dealt with the sticky clutch and the passenger dealt with the imperfect weather stripping and life went on matt was holding his fathers wedding ring in his hand he was preparing himself to put it on he knew it would mean something if it fit he knew itd mean something if it didnt and he didnt know which he wanted more

in the envelope presented by the orderly had been only a few things dads wallet his wedding ring moms wedding ring his wristwatch stopped and a letter sealed the rings were absolutely dads prized possessions and hed always said they were worth more than anything else hed ever owned or would ever own again they were how hed convinced his their mom to marry him every day working at the grocery from the first day she started working hed leave his desk in the managers office and pass her register and ask her to lunch and every day she said no until i said yes shed interrupt and take up the story with a smile it was that same smile shed give when she said no that told me shed say yes dad would say

matt was seeing the scene play out in the dark and wet outside the window theyd have lunch together every day and every day from that first lunch hed ask so when will we get married and she would reply every time never david taylor i wont be married to a grocery store assistant manager one day when he asked he showed her the ring hed bought for her well how about just engaged then they were sitting side by side on a parking barrier watching the park beyond then they were looking at each other over each others shoulders dad doing his terrible approximation of a charming smile mom totally falling for it she took the ring and put it on and said oh no am i really going to be mrs layla taylor and kissed dad through his laughter but he wouldnt stop laughing

and just what is so funny she asked

well youre not going to be layla taylor you already are he said david had a weird sense of humor

oh is that right

yup i knew i only had one shot at you saying yes and you know on my salary i couldnt afford four rings so i had the engagement and wedding rings made together

that is not how that works layla half laughed eyebrows furrowed and we are done with our lunch break

sure it is i was going to get you a silver engagement ring and gold wedding rings but instead i had our rings made of electrum  half silver and half gold im sorry mrs taylor youre stuck with me

maybe its you whos stuck with me mr taylor or maybe ill make you take my last name

david davis you couldnt be so cruel im not a marvel superhero

mr david davis will see you now welcome to keatings heating and leons freon and they laughed all the way back to the grocery they laughed every day after for forty years



jody and matt met the next day at davids house theyd agreed to sell it but it needed some sprucing up and theyd just never gotten around to it theyd both been hassling him about it for years but if it was one thing dad was good at it was not listening to his kids theyd teased him for years whenever they wanted to make a point ok dont listen to me now just like you didnt listen in  when i told you to buy bitcoin or sure dont listen to me now just like i told you that buying a chinese electric car was a bad idea or sure dont listen now like you refused to switch to solar for ten years until they stopped handing out grants

the table the couches all the furniture has got to go the wallpaper that stove should be replaced who didnt go induction just mom and dad

jody where will the money for all this come from

the stager said if we do what she listed well get a lot more faster for the old place

yeah  but where will the money come from

its an investment she dragged out the word especially the s

yeah but

 where will the money come from its not that much in the long run and if we can sell the house quick then itll

uh huh so we fix it up then we have to worry about selling fast and end up taking a low offer come on jody as is be done with it there was a pause i see youre wearing moms ring

i see youre wearing dads

they sat at the kitchen table styrofoam cups of coffee between them i guess we both remember how they always said they never worried when they thought about their wedgagement rings ill take mine off sometime i always sort of mean to put it away somewhere matt said

yeah me too oh that reminds me i opened that letter it was sweet she passed it to matt who pulled it from the envelope opened it and read it it was handwritten very neatly

gtkids  
gt  
gti know youre not kids anymore or i hope you arent i know no matter how old you are when you read this that youll always be kids to me youre both snoring in your rooms right now and im sat in the kitchen with mom we both love you very much and we wish we could give you easier lives but as it is what we can do is provide for now and try to teach you to provide for yourselves in the future theres no such thing as true security in this world but seeing you sleep soundly in your beds i know weve helped you feel as safe and secure as you deserve when you read this your mom and i will both be gone but well have done our best for you and we want you two to do your best for yourselves and each other youre going to have to take care of one another youre going to have to be partners david i want you to have my wedding ring jody mom wants you to have hers dont worry if they dont fit just dont sell them or lose them they mean more than you know  
gt  
gtdavid your mom said i should listen to you more i am taking her advice every week from now on  
gt  
gt dad  
gt  
gtjune 

guess we read his mind huh jody said spinning their moms ring on her finger

yeah but what about listening to me guess he forgot they both laughed just briefly one thing about dad he did like to write i never saw it before but his ring has a pretty long inscription inside can barely make it out

yeah moms too but you didnt know mom said they had them engraved when we were little kids to remind them of our future i should get a magnifying glass or something



the reading of the will was rather brief david didnt have much he left the house to the kids jointly thank god it was paid off he left his camaro to jodys son when he can handle it and if he waxes it and everything else he also split between jody and matt including hed written in his typical romantic joking fashion my true treasure and wealth which is entirely in electrum and always close at hand my dear children i hope you listen to me as closely as ive listened to you



three weeks later the house was clean painted staged and ready for showing matt had the feeling of putting a ballgown on a corpse the realtor walked up admiring the new paint and trimmed shrubs

hope you dont mind i brought you the mail from the mailbox

oh good bills matt said and rifled through them wait there must be a mistake this is the right address but this and this all these theyre from that bitcoin utility and trust company that only accepts bitcoin mom and dad never had any david opened the electric bill dear  persimmon dr your electricity bill has been paid from the btc address provided your balance is  ‚Çø thank you for your continued loyalty remember to keep your electric bill from going to the moon turn off your lights at night matt opened another dear  persimmon dr your taxes have been paid from the btc address provided if your owner disputes the calculated amount they can contact dear mr taylor estate of your vacation property is awaiting claim there is ‚Çø remaining in your rental account at the time of this writing that balance will be exhausted in  months dear mr taylor

matt awoke to jodys husband standing over him fanning his face with a newspaper his eyes focused he could see jody beyond reading the envelopes he heard her ask if dad had a secret second family or something what the heck was going on jody knelt by matt holding his hand in hers and helped him sit up david took his turn with the mail jesus he said the old man was sophisticated enough to keep bitcoin and savvy enough to keep it secret and he still got paper bills jodys contribution was oh shut up harold matt you need some water harold get him some water

when harold returned with the water he had his cellphone out his mouth was agape matt was reaching for the water but harold drank it all in one gulp stammered apologetically and went to get more when he came back he gave jody his phone she looked from the phone to one of the account statements then back to the phone again and again

she looked at harold he nodded she showed matt the phone he couldnt make out the address completely just the number of btc in a daze matt took out his phone and called home his daughter answered honey he said go get grampas ring from my night table and tell me how many words are written inside",he never listened,2021-01-03

it is not a big problem as bitcoin doesnt need to get faster to be successful it already is and will continue to be

but it can be better and itll be adopted by millions if it could be used in everyday transactions viably and would put the nail in the coffin of our current system

ive heard and learnt about the lightning network but a lot of people call it a failure and say itll never work why hasnt it worked and will we ever find a way to increase bitcoins own transaction speed

and are there any proposed alternative solutions offered that could be a viable way to fix bitcoins transaction speed

ive heard people mention that altcoins can be used as a sort of silver to the gold that is bitcoin i understand that and even people saying bitcoin cash will take over once bitcoin has become mainstream adopted enough for people to switch to a better alternative thats fine as we will decide in the future by committee which coin will be our money its all speculation right now

but i exactly just want to know what limits btc from just being sped up and improved if the code is opensource and mainstream adoption will incentivise everybody to work and improve on bitcoin

i just had quite a stressful experience transferring some funds from a paper wallet to an exchange

i‚Äôve written the story below share my experience to help any others in the same situation and perhaps improve the user experience

i used the android mycelium wallet as it has been around for years and had good reputation years ago 

i was using blockchaininfo but it seems the paper wallet functionality has been completely broken by updates

after scanning an encrypted paper wallet  i chose to send  of the  to an exchange

i quickly received the funds but notice that the transaction showed

 from paperwallet transferred to  exchange and  to  a new address starting with 

 

this is when i started to panic and suspected mycelium had become illegitimate

there is a lot of adds and banners bloating the app

i was convinced it had skimmed some of my transaction into another address

after several frustrating attempts at importing the encrypted key in another wallet to get the remaining  i finally got them out of the potentially compromised paper wallet using an old version of httpsbitaddressorg and electrum in windows

this whole time i was rushing and disregarding some normal security protocols in an attempt the get the funds off before any malicious actor might







after a stressful hour i discovered that when importing a  private key mycelium lists  addresses that the key corresponds to

when i did a partial spend the  was sent to this other address ‚Ä¶

i was able to rescan the paper wallet with mycelium and spend the  from ‚Ä¶

all in all it was a very stressful experience and i did a number of risky things in my panic

"will everyone or atleast in western world use bitcoins for everyday transactions 

if yes can bitcoin system handle the complex transaction structure of millions of exchange occuring 

will there be extra fees for low amount of transactions

suppose one loaf of bread costs  will it costs the same or will there be extra fees 

assuming some people dont use third party exchange but use cold wallet and they do deals like buying a plot of land with other party agrreing in btc payment how would that transaction be not illegal wouldnt govt want to be third eye and get its tax share


one last question if everyone is saying here to buy bitcoins no matter what and hold assuming it hits  or  the point lets say everyone held their btc and ater started selling wouldnt price fall down who would buy it then even if there is goal why is no one talking about it satoshi didnt make the system for pump and dump he wanted a currency that isnt centralised yet no major decentralised system other than core itself",will bitcoin be the future currency,2021-01-01

"since there are many people sharing their bitcoin stories i want to share mine

i learned about bitcoin from a coworker soon after starting a position at nasa goddard in early  where worked to manage weather satellite algorithms he had been using some old gpus to mine in his basement and showed me the genesis block hash functions and live blockchain transactions as they came over the network it was clearly a sideproject for him but i began taking my own interest in it when i came home from work

it was my first job after grad school and i had just finished setting up my  benefits when i decided to buy a little bitcoin as well i figured that if public markets were theoretically the most intelligently priced bitcoin must have a lot of potential because it was the freest market imaginable this came at a time of living in the dc area and an exposure to national politics and spending time writing a personal novel downtown after work when i didn‚Äôt have many connections i learned about quantitative easing fiscal policy and the move off the gold standard it further solidified my bitcoin obsession and i wound up on poloniex from the june  altcoin season of course i was a newbie and lost just as much as i gained in the end i realized all i cared about was increasing my btc and eos position at the time back then it was and still is only a moderate amount

after that i held until the end of the year when i sold a bunch of btc and paid off my car but all along i knew it was a short term top so my obsession continued i ended up leaving my job at nasa to find a blockchain group where i could use my software engineering skills i did indeed find a healthcare startup but didn‚Äôt have the web experience to contribute much to the team

last year my primarily financial obsession with bitcoin changed when i slowly formulated an idea i was and still am obsessed with blockchain eosio in particular and i found some place to feel at peace with the price swings and missed opportunities margin trading    applying my knowledge and understanding of climate i started a company to launch weather balloons in west africa to collect weather data and reward students with digital currency i learned about microcontrollers iot web development and  printing and made my prototype ideas a reality i feel compelled to do this because i believe there are only a handful of people that have the technical background in weather software and climate to found a company like this

two months ago a press release by coindesk was shared on nasdaq‚Äôs website



even though my btc stacks are only moderate i don‚Äôt feel as though i‚Äôm missing an opportunity by not leveraging long on an exchange because i see my project as a call option on crypto in general

maybe there‚Äôs someone else out there that feels guilty about not leveraging their own btc to make even more profit if that‚Äôs case i encourage them to get creative and use their own background to improve or change society in one way or another after all we all come from different places and can bring something new to the table",my story from nasa to bitcoin,2021-01-01

"short version

decentralized group of oracles publish pgp public keys followed after a delay by the corresponding private keys bitcoiners can get some physical security by time locking keys needed to spend utxos by encrypting the spend keys to a pgp public key published by the oracle in order to spend the funds they must wait for the private key to be published if a robber asks them to send funds it is not possible to do so without waiting for the timeout or by some other method that is not attractive for the robber this is sort of like cltv but you can ‚Äúrenew‚Äù the timeout without making an on chain transaction



long version

as the price of bitcoin goes up bitcoin holders may worry about their physical security the best case scenario is when no one knows about the wealth you control but this may not be achievable for everyone due to exchange data spills kyc record keeping tax reporting requirements or other information leaks

what can you do to protect yourself from the dreaded five dollar wrench attack or hostage ransom attack a dog and a shotgun are nice to have but it is fundamentally very difficult to defend yourself from a physical attack from a smart patient adversary

it‚Äôs worth noticing that there have been publicly identifiable rich people for a long time yet robberies and hostage attacks remain infrequent unfortunately bitcoin has properties that give reason to suspect that physical attacks could be more likely

 you do not need to involve or inform any other people to transfer bitcoin to an attacker‚Äôs address bitcoin transfers are private

 you can transfer a fortune in bitcoin within a few minutes bitcoin transfers are fast

 bitcoin transfers are irreversible

these properties are great to have when you need them but having all three could be a big liability if it attracts robbers

in order to thwart attackers it would be a good idea to set it up so that you cannot have all three at the same time for example you could lock your coins with a script that allows the coins to be spent either with the help of a third party or no sooner than one year in the future that way you cannot pay a robber without involving the third party and if the third party fails you get your coins back at the end of the year

as a more flexible variation on the above idea suppose that there were some oracle ‚Äî perhaps a tor hidden service ‚Äî that simply published a pgp public key every day and then  days later it published the corresponding private key perhaps it would sell the private key for a fee over the lightning network now your coins could be locked with a script that opens two ways

 you can spend the coins immediately

 you can spend the coins at the end of one year

then you encrypt the spend key for option  to the pgp key of the oracle and delete your unencrypted copies of the spend key now the coins are locked for  days until the oracle publishes the pgp private key once the pgp private key is published you could decrypt your spend private key and if you like you could encrypt it again to a new pgp public key published by the oracle to again lock the coins for  days



automatic lock renewal

as a method to automatically renew the lock what you could do is the following

 oracle has a list of  secrets it switches to the next secret every day after the final secret it switches back to the first secret
 you send a secret to the oracle and ask to make a public key
 the oracle combines your secret with the oracles secret for that day oracle uses a secure hash to combine the oracle secret and your secret lets say the secret is an ecies private key
 the oracle sends you back the corresponding public key
 you encrypt your file to the public key and delete the original
 now you have to wait until  days pass and the oracle returns to the correct secret so that you are able to obtain your key if you do not obtain the secret the window closes at the end of the day for  more days
 attacker cannot get your private key from the oracle before robbing you because they do not have your secret

keys in the oracle carousel could expire after some number of rotations eg expire after  rotations and become accessible every day for some grace period like  year so that people can use them to decrypt their files and move them to a different carousel key



additional thoughts

 oracles could publish a pgp public key each day and make the corresponding private key accessible one year later if you wanted to lock your coins for a shorter time just pick an older pgp public key for example pick one published  days ago so that you can get the private key in  days

 for redundancy you could encrypt your private key with pgp keys from several different oracles

 wallets could handle all of this timelocking behind the scenes and simply present the user with a ‚Äúlock coins for x days‚Äù interface

 locking can occur on a perutxo basis so you could stagger your utxos on the calendar eg you could give yourself access to a different chunk of bitcoin each month for  months

 if you find that you need to sell a bunch of bitcoin but yours are all locked up you can always use loans and futures contracts

 an alternative to cltv for a backup spend method could be something like an m of n shamir scheme with shards at several bank deposit boxes lawyer etc

 oracle‚Äôs could get paid for private keys with lightning and use lightning capacity as an anti sybil proof

 this idea is very private and decentralized for example the oracle has no insight into who uses the service or how much money is being protected",key calendar for physical security,2021-01-01

i just had quite a stressful experience transferring some funds from a paper wallet to an exchange

i‚Äôve written the story below share my experience to help any others in the same situation and perhaps improve the user experience

i used the android mycelium wallet as it has been around for years and had good reputation years ago 

i was using blockchaininfo but it seems the paper wallet functionality has been completely broken by updates

after scanning an encrypted paper wallet  i chose to send  of the  to an exchange

i quickly received the funds but notice that the transaction showed

 from paperwallet transferred to  exchange and  to  a new address starting with 

 

this is when i started to panic and suspected mycelium had become illegitimate

there is a lot of adds and banners bloating the app

i was convinced it had skimmed some of my transaction into another address

after several frustrating attempts at importing the encrypted key in another wallet to get the remaining  i finally got them out of the potentially compromised paper wallet using an old version of httpsbitaddressorg and electrum in windows

this whole time i was rushing and disregarding some normal security protocols in an attempt the get the funds off before any malicious actor might







after a stressful hour i discovered that when importing a  private key mycelium lists  addresses that the key corresponds to

when i did a partial spend the  was sent to this other address ‚Ä¶

i was able to rescan the paper wallet with mycelium and spend the  from ‚Ä¶

all in all it was a very stressful experience and i did a number of risky things in my panic  
 i considered myself fairly knowledgeable in bitcoin and yet this still happened

"since there are many people sharing their bitcoin stories i want to share mine

i learned about bitcoin from a coworker soon after starting a position at nasa goddard in early  where worked to manage weather satellite algorithms he had been using some old gpus to mine in his basement and showed me the genesis block hash functions and live blockchain transactions as they came over the network it was clearly a sideproject for him but i began taking my own interest in it when i came home from work

it was my first job after grad school and i had just finished setting up my  benefits when i decided to buy a little bitcoin as well i figured that if public markets were theoretically the most intelligently priced bitcoin must have a lot of potential because it was the freest market imaginable this came at a time of living in the dc area and an exposure to national politics and spending time writing a personal novel downtown after work when i didn‚Äôt have many connections i learned about quantitative easing fiscal policy and the move off the gold standard it further solidified my bitcoin obsession and i wound up on poloniex from the june  altcoin season of course i was a newbie and lost just as much as i gained in the end i realized all i cared about was increasing my btc and eos position at the time back then it was and still is only a moderate amount

after that i held until the end of the year when i sold a bunch of btc and paid off my car but all along i knew it was a short term top so my obsession continued i ended up leaving my job at nasa to find a blockchain group where i could use my software engineering skills i did indeed find a healthcare startup but didn‚Äôt have the web experience to contribute much to the team

last year my primarily financial obsession with bitcoin changed when i slowly formulated an idea i was and still am obsessed with blockchain eosio in particular and i found some place to feel at peace with the price swings and missed opportunities margin trading    applying my knowledge and understanding of climate i started a company to launch weather balloons in west africa to collect weather data and reward students with digital currency i learned about microcontrollers iot web development and  printing and made my prototype ideas a reality i feel compelled to do this because i believe there are only a handful of people that have the technical background in weather software and climate to found a company like this

two months ago a press release by coindesk was shared on nasdaq‚Äôs website



even though my btc stacks are only moderate i don‚Äôt feel as though i‚Äôm missing an opportunity by not leveraging long on an exchange because i see my project as a call option on crypto in general

maybe there‚Äôs someone else out there that feels guilty about not leveraging their own btc to make even more profit if that‚Äôs case i encourage them to get creative and use their own background to improve or change society in one way or another after all we all come from different places and can bring something new to the table",my story from nasa to bitcoin,2021-01-01

"short version

decentralized group of oracles publish pgp public keys followed after a delay by the corresponding private keys bitcoiners can get some physical security by time locking keys needed to spend utxos by encrypting the spend keys to a pgp public key published by the oracle in order to spend the funds they must wait for the private key to be published if a robber asks them to send funds it is not possible to do so without waiting for the timeout or by some other method that is not attractive for the robber this is sort of like cltv but you can ‚Äúrenew‚Äù the timeout without making an on chain transaction



long version

as the price of bitcoin goes up bitcoin holders may worry about their physical security the best case scenario is when no one knows about the wealth you control but this may not be achievable for everyone due to exchange data spills kyc record keeping tax reporting requirements or other information leaks

what can you do to protect yourself from the dreaded five dollar wrench attack or hostage ransom attack a dog and a shotgun are nice to have but it is fundamentally very difficult to defend yourself from a physical attack from a smart patient adversary

it‚Äôs worth noticing that there have been publicly identifiable rich people for a long time yet robberies and hostage attacks remain infrequent unfortunately bitcoin has properties that give reason to suspect that physical attacks could be more likely

 you do not need to involve or inform any other people to transfer bitcoin to an attacker‚Äôs address bitcoin transfers are private

 you can transfer a fortune in bitcoin within a few minutes bitcoin transfers are fast

 bitcoin transfers are irreversible

these properties are great to have when you need them but having all three could be a big liability if it attracts robbers

in order to thwart attackers it would be a good idea to set it up so that you cannot have all three at the same time for example you could lock your coins with a script that allows the coins to be spent either with the help of a third party or no sooner than one year in the future that way you cannot pay a robber without involving the third party and if the third party fails you get your coins back at the end of the year

as a more flexible variation on the above idea suppose that there were some oracle ‚Äî perhaps a tor hidden service ‚Äî that simply published a pgp public key every day and then  days later it published the corresponding private key perhaps it would sell the private key for a fee over the lightning network now your coins could be locked with a script that opens two ways

 you can spend the coins immediately

 you can spend the coins at the end of one year

then you encrypt the spend key for option  to the pgp key of the oracle and delete your unencrypted copies of the spend key now the coins are locked for  days until the oracle publishes the pgp private key once the pgp private key is published you could decrypt your spend private key and if you like you could encrypt it again to a new pgp public key published by the oracle to again lock the coins for  days



automatic lock renewal

as a method to automatically renew the lock what you could do is the following

 oracle has a list of  secrets it switches to the next secret every day after the final secret it switches back to the first secret
 you send a secret to the oracle and ask to make a public key
 the oracle combines your secret with the oracles secret for that day oracle uses a secure hash to combine the oracle secret and your secret lets say the secret is an ecies private key
 the oracle sends you back the corresponding public key
 you encrypt your file to the public key and delete the original
 now you have to wait until  days pass and the oracle returns to the correct secret so that you are able to obtain your key if you do not obtain the secret the window closes at the end of the day for  more days
 attacker cannot get your private key from the oracle before robbing you because they do not have your secret

keys in the oracle carousel could expire after some number of rotations eg expire after  rotations and become accessible every day for some grace period like  year so that people can use them to decrypt their files and move them to a different carousel key



additional thoughts

 oracles could publish a pgp public key each day and make the corresponding private key accessible one year later if you wanted to lock your coins for a shorter time just pick an older pgp public key for example pick one published  days ago so that you can get the private key in  days

 for redundancy you could encrypt your private key with pgp keys from several different oracles

 wallets could handle all of this timelocking behind the scenes and simply present the user with a ‚Äúlock coins for x days‚Äù interface

 locking can occur on a perutxo basis so you could stagger your utxos on the calendar eg you could give yourself access to a different chunk of bitcoin each month for  months

 if you find that you need to sell a bunch of bitcoin but yours are all locked up you can always use loans and futures contracts

 an alternative to cltv for a backup spend method could be something like an m of n shamir scheme with shards at several bank deposit boxes lawyer etc

 oracle‚Äôs could get paid for private keys with lightning and use lightning capacity as an anti sybil proof

 this idea is very private and decentralized for example the oracle has no insight into who uses the service or how much money is being protected",key calendar for physical security,2021-01-01
